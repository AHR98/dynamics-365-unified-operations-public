# Manage shipping containers

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Shipping containers are used to group goods that either are physically grouped together or are required to share costs only across those goods (normally because they are physically together).

To view and process goods through the shipping container form, go to **Landed cost \> Shipping containers \> All shipping containers**. This opens a list of available shipping containers. Select a container to view its details.

On the shipping container details page, shipping container and costing information is shown on the top half of the page. Folios, items and purchase orders or transfer orders attached to the container are found on the lines section of the page.

## Header view

### General

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Shipping Container type** | This must be entered and can determine the cost for freight for example by selecting the auto cost associated to the shipping container type. |
| **Vessel** | The vessel is selected or entered here. Even though it is a drop-down field it allows free text within it. If the vessel is not listed and the user decides to enter free text it does not update the main table for future selection. For more information, refer to [Vessels](shipping-information-setup.md#vessels). |
| **Unit type** | Unit types are used as an additional grouping and identification method against a shipping container. They are shown and selected on the shipping container form. For more information, refer to [Set up unit types](shipping-container-setup.md#unit-types). |
| **Refrigeration type** | Refrigeration types are used as an additional grouping and identification method against a shipping container, normally for refrigerated containers. They are shown and selected on the shipping container form. For more information, refer to [Set up refrigeration types](shipping-container-setup.md#refrigeration-types). |
| **Measurement** | This allows for a measurement to be specified within the Landed cost module. This is often used by organizations that do not know the individual volume/weight of the goods, but they require a more accurate apportionment than amount or quantity. The freight forwarder will supply them with the kg&#39;s or cubic measurement which they place at either an item level or purchase order level. It can be automatically updated if the parameter is selected or manually input. |
| **Measurement unit** | Unit of measure relating to the number in the measurement field. |
| **Actual weight** | The actual weight can be recorded of the carton/container. This can be used to verify against the maximum weight allowed on a shipping container setup. |
| **Number of cartons** | The number of cartons is automatically updated if the parameter is selected. |
| **Description of goods** | Description of goods can be selected from the shipping container or folio header and is used to assist in identifying a voyage/shipping container/folio of goods. For more information, refer to [Description of goods](shipping-information-setup.md#description-of-goods). |
| **H.A.W.B/Bill of lading** | House air waybill or Bill of Lading can be specified against the shipping container. |
| **Remarks** | Additional information relating to the shipping container. |

### Delivery

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **Created date and time** | Created date and time of the container. |
| **Ex-factory date** | This date is normally given to the factory/vendor to advise them when you expect the goods to leave their premises. Often dealing with a factory in Asia will require this date as opposed to the date that you expect the goods by which is normally the case for a local delivery. This field can be populated by the purchase order lines on the shipping container list or by manual entry on this form. |
| **Ship date** | This date can be printed on the purchase order document. It normally advises the factory/vendor when the goods should be delivered to the port by. This is an informational field only and is not used to estimate the expected delivery date of the goods within the shipping container. This field can be set to automatically update when the tracking control form is updated. |
| **Estimated delivery date** | This is normally the date that the goods are due to arrive in the warehouse. This field is informational only and is not used to calculate master planning on the purchase order lines within the shipping container. The expected delivery date on the Purchase lines is updated through tracking control. This field can be set to update when the tracking control form is updated. |
| **Departure date** | The departure date is normally the date the plane or vessel actually leaves the overseas port. |
| **Estimated time of arrival at port** | This is the estimated arrival date at the destination port or &quot;To port&quot;. |
| **Original documents received** | Optionally, update the date original documents were received. |
| **Broker advised** | Optionally, update the date broker was advised. |

 |
| **Local forwarder** | This is for informational purposes; the local forwarder should be selectable from the vendor table. |
| **Local transport date** | Store the date the local transport is booked for. This can assist the warehouse in their planning. |
| **Local transport time** | Store the time slot, again this can assist the warehouse in their planning |
| **Journey template** | The journey template specified for the voyage. The journey template will provide the details of the to and from port as well as the lead times associated to the tracking control of the shipping container. |

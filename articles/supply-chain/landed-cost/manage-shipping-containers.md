# Manage shipping containers

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Shipping containers are used to group together goods that are physically grouped together. They are also used in cases where costs must be shared only across those goods, usually because they are physically together.

To view and process goods through the shipping container page, go to **Landed cost \> Shipping containers \> All shipping containers**. The **All shipping containers** page shows a list of all available shipping containers. Select a container to view its details.

The upper part of the shipping container details page shows shipping container and costing information. The **Lines** section shows the folios, items, and purchase orders or transfer orders that are attached to the container.

### Settings on the General FastTab

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Shipping container type | Enter the shipping container type. This field must be set. You can use it to determine the cost for freight, for example, by selecting the auto cost that is associated with the shipping container type. |
| Vessel | Enter or select the vessel. If the vessel isn't listed as a value, you can enter the vessel ID as free text. In that case, the main table isn't updated so that the vessel ID can be selected in this field later. For more information, see [Vessels](shipping-information-setup.md#vessels). |
| Unit type | Unit types are used as an additional means of grouping and identifying shipping containers. They are shown and selected on the shipping container page. For more information, see [Set up unit types](shipping-container-setup.md#unit-types). |
| Refrigeration type | Refrigeration types are used as an additional means of grouping and identifying shipping containers, usually refrigerated containers. They are shown and selected on the shipping container page. For more information, see [Set up refrigeration types](shipping-container-setup.md#refrigeration-types). |
| Measurement | This field enables a measurement to be specified in the **Landed cost** module. Measurements are often used by organizations that don't know the individual volume or weight of goods, but that require a more accurate apportionment than the amount or quantity provides. The freight forwarder will provide the weight in kilograms or the cubic measurement, and you can put it at the level of either an item or the purchase order. It can be automatically updated if the parameter is selected, or it can be manually entered. |
| Measurement unit | The unit of measure that applies to the number in the **Measurement** field. |
| Actual weight | You can record the actual weight of the carton or container. This value can be used for verification against the maximum weight that is allowed in the setup of a shipping container. |
| Number of cartons | The number of cartons is automatically updated if the parameter is selected. |
| Description of goods | A description of goods can be selected on the shipping container or folio header. It's used to help identify a voyage, shipping container, or folio of goods. For more information, see [Description of goods](shipping-information-setup.md#description-of-goods). |
| H.A.W.B/Bill of lading | You can specify the house air waybill or bill of lading for the shipping container. |
| Remarks | Additional information that is related to the shipping container. |

### Settings on the Delivery FastTab

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| Created date and time | The date and time when the container was created. |
| Ex-factory date | This date is usually provided to the factory/vendor to indicate when you expect the goods to leave its premises. When you work with a factory in Asia, this date is often required instead of the date that you expect the goods by. (By contrast, for a local delivery, the date that you expect the goods by is required.) This field can be filled in from the purchase order lines in the shipping container list. You can also manually enter it here. |
| Ship date | This date can be printed on the purchase order document. It usually informs the factory/vendor about the date that the goods should be delivered to the port by. This field is for informational purposes only. It isn't used to estimate the expected delivery date of the goods in the shipping container. This field can be set to that it's automatically updated when the tracking control page is updated. |
| Estimated delivery date | Usually, the date when the goods are due to arrive in the warehouse. This field is for informational purposes only. It isn't used to calculate master planning on the purchase order lines in the shipping container. The expected delivery date on the purchase order lines is updated through tracking control. This field can be set up so that it's updated when the tracking control page is updated. |
| Departure date | Usually, the date when the plane or vessel actually leaves the overseas port. |
| Estimated time of arrival at port | The estimated arrival date at the destination port ("to" port). |
| Original documents received | Optional: Update the date when the original documents were received. |
| Broker advised | Optional: Update the date when the broker was advised. |
| Original bill of lading sent | Optional: Update the date when the original bill of lading was sent. |
| Goods released | Optional: Update the date when the goods were released. |
| Customer appointment | Optional: Update the customer appointment date. |
| Delivered at warehouse | Optional: Update the date when the goods were delivered to the warehouse. |
| Verification date | Optional: Update the verification date. |
| Delivery instructions | Optional: Update the date of the delivery instructions. |
| Local forwarder | This field is for informational purposes only. The local forwarder should be selectable from the vendor table. |
| Local transport date | Enter the date that the local transport is booked for. This field can help the warehouse do its planning. |
| Local transport time | Enter the time slot. This field can help the warehouse do its planning. |
| Journey template | The journey template that is specified for the voyage. The journey template provides the details of the "to" and "from" ports, and the lead times that are associated with the tracking control of the shipping container. |

### Buttons

| Button | Description |
|---|---|
| New | Create a voyage. <!-- KFM: For more information about the voyage creation process, see the scenario documentation. --> |
| Delete | Delete a voyage. Only voyages that have a status of *Confirmed* can be deleted. After a voyage has begun the goods-in-transit process, it can no longer be deleted. |
| Voyage costs | View or add voyage costs to all the goods in the shipping container. Voyage costs that are manually added on the shipping container page apply only to the items in the shipping container, not to the whole voyage. Therefore, users can add shipping containerâ€“level costs to a voyage if they were missed during auto cost creation. All voyage costs that are associated with the shipping container will be shown, regardless of the cost code type definition. |

### Buttons on the Manage tab

| Button | Descriptions |
|---|---|

| Invoice | Post an invoice for all purchase order lines in the shipping container. If multi-company shipments are used, a new invoice posting dialog box is opened for each company. |

| Receive | Post a transfer order receipt for all transfer order lines in the shipping container. The receive dialog box is the simplest way to receive goods in a shipping container or voyage, and is one of three available options. You can also receive via arrival journals or mobile device processing. |

The receive dialog box is the simplest way to receive goods in a shipping container or voyage, and is one of three available options. You can also receive via arrival journals or mobile device processing. |

Do you want to overwrite them?"</p><p>**Note:** Voyage costs that are attached to a shipping container and that have been invoiced won't be overwritten.</p> |
| Create arrival journal | You can generate an arrival journal for organizations by using advanced warehouse features.

The last two options depend on whether goods-in-transit processing is being used. |

| Rename | Select this button to open a dialog box where you can rename a selected shipping container. |

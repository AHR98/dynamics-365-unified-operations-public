# Rebate statuses

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Rebate statuses help you to track the status of each Rebate management deal or contract. <!-- KFM: Are "agreements", "contracts" and "deals" always the same thing? If so, we should use "deals" everywhere to match the UI. --> You can also use statuses for reporting and inquiry purposes. You can set up and name as many rebate status values as you need to support your business process. 

To set up the rebate statuses, go to **Rebate management \> Setup \> Status \> Status**. Use commands on the Action Pane to add and remove status values as needed. For each status, make the following settings:

- **Rebate status** - Enter a name for the status (such as Negotiating, Agreed or Completed).
- **Description** - Enter a description of the status to provide more information about how it should be used.

You can choose the default status to be assigned to all new Rebate management deals by going to the [**Rebate management parameters** page](rebate-management-parameters.md).

# Packing station not displaying product notes

KB Number: 4614615

The packing notes are not displayed on the packing form when packing instructions attachment is added either to a product master or a product variant. 


## Resolution
Microsoft has evaluated this issue and determined not to fix this issue as a hot-fix.
The current logic for displaying packing notes on the packing form requires the notes to be associated with the shipments.

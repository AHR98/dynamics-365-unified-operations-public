# Marking between Transfer order receipt and batch order is not working correctly when using "Firm and consolidate"

KB Number: 4612127

Marking between Transfer order receipt and batch order is not working correctly when using "Firm and consolidate"
 


## Resolution
Setting "no" for marking in explosion view has no effect only on the firming that particular order. When firming and consolidate is done that action has no effect. To change update marking behavior for firming go to Master planning parameters > Standard update.

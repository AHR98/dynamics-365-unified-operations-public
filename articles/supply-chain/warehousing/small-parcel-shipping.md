# Small parcel shipping

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The small parcel shipping (SPS) feature allows Supply Chain Management to interact directly with shipping carriers by providing a framework for communicating through carrier APIs. This functionality is useful for when you are shipping individual sales orders via commercial shipping carriers as opposed to using container shipping or less than truckload (LTL) shipping.

The SPS feature interacts with your shipping carrier through a dedicated *rate engine*, which your organization must develop in collaboration with your carrier or carrier hub service. The rate engine enables Supply Chain Management to submit details about a packed container to your carrier and receive back a shipping label, shipping rate, and tracking number. The returned rate will be added to the associated sales order as a miscellaneous charge. You can then print the returned label automatically using a Zebra Programming Language (ZPL) printer and apply the label to the shipment. The carrier will scan this label when they pick up the packages at your warehouse.

## Prepare your system to support small parcel shipping

Before you can begin using small parcel shipping features, you must enable the SPS feature in feature management, add your rate engine, and set up the Transportation management and Warehouse management modules to support it.

### Turn on the SPS feature

Before you can use this feature, it must be turned on in your system. Administrators can use the [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) page to check the feature status and enable it if needed. Here, the feature is listed as:

- **Module** - *Transportation management*
- **Feature name** - *Small parcel shipping*

### Deploy and set up your rate engines

Supply Chain Management does not include any rate engines. You must obtain or create them as needed and then add them to your system. However, Microsoft also provides a demo rate engine that you can use for testing.

#### Download and deploy the demo rate engine

To get the demo rate engine:

1. Download the [demo rate engine DLL on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/Dynamics-365-FastTrack-Implementation-Assets/tree/master/SCM/SPS).
1. On your Supply Chain Management server, save the downloaded DLL in the following folder:  
`\AOSService\PackagesLocalDirectory\ApplicationSuite\bin`

#### Create and deploy functional rate engines

For details about how to create and deploy functional rate engines for use on a production or test environment, see the following topics:

- [Create a new transportation management engine](../transportation/create-new-transportation-management-engine.md)
- [Set up transportation management engines](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/set-up-transportation-management-engines)

More information about how to create an SPS rate engine is available on the following blog post: [Small Parcel Shipping: How to leverage small parcel shipping functionality in Microsoft Dynamics 365](https://hub.bhsolutions.com/creating-a-mock-parcel-engine-in-d365?submissionGuid=46a1fccf-80b0-4b70-a6a0-4bf45a8756b5).

#### Set up a rate engine in Supply Chain Management

After you have created and deployed rate engine for SPS, follow these steps to set up the new rate engine:

1. Go to **Transportation management \> Setup \> Engines \> Rate engine**.

1. On the Action Pane, select **New** to add a new row to the grid.

1. Make the following settings for the new row:
    - **Rating engine** - Enter a unique name for this rate engine. (For the demo rate engine, enter *Demo rate engine*.)
    - **Name** - Enter a short description of this rate engine. (For the demo rate engine, enter *Demo rate engine*.)
    - **Rating metadata ID** - Select the basis by which your rate will be calculated (such as by distance). (For the demo rate engine, you can leave this blank.)
    - **Engine assembly** - Enter the file name of the DLL package that you have deployed. (For the demo rate engine, this is `TMSSmallParcelShippingEngine.dll`.)
    - **Engine class** - Enter the class name established for your rate engine. (For the demo rate engine, this is `TMSSmallParcelShippingEngine.SmallParcelShippingRateEngine`.)

## Example scenario

This example scenario shows how to set up and use SPS once you have prepared your system as described earlier in this topic. This scenario uses the demo rate engine described previously.

### Enable demo data

To work through this scenario using the demo records and values that are specified here, you must be on a system where the standard [demo data](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/deployment/deploy-demo-environment.md) is installed. Additionally, you must select the **USMF** legal entity before you begin.

### Set up the scenario

For this example scenario, you will need a demo carrier, carrier group, packing policy, and packing profile. The following subsections explain how to prepare the records needed for the scenario. In a production scenario, you would typically set each of these up in a similar way, but you would specify different values from those suggested here.

#### Set up carriers

Set up carrier by doing the following:

1. Go to **Transportation management \> Setup \> Carriers \> Shipping carriers**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **New** to add a new carrier.
1. Make the following settings in the header section of the page:
    - **Shipping carrier** - *Demo Carrier*
    - **Name** - *Demo Carrier*
    - **Mode** - *Ground*
1. On the **Overview** FastTab, make the following settings:
    - **Activate shipping carrier** - *Yes*
    - **Activate carrier rating** - *Yes*
1. On the **Services** FastTab, select **New** from the toolbar to add a new service to the grid.
1. Make the following settings for the new service:
    - **Carrier service** - *Demo carrier service*
    - **Name** - *Demo carrier service*
    - **Transportation method** - *Ground*

    Enter arbitrary values for all of the other columns as needed. (A new **Mode of delivery** will be created and set automatically when you save the new shipping carrier record.)
1. On the **Rating profiles** FastTab, select **New** from the toolbar to add a new profile to the grid.
1. Make the following settings for the new rating profile:
    - **Rating profile** - *Demo carrier service*
    - **Name** - *Demo carrier service*
    - **Rate engine** - *Demo rate engine*

    Enter arbitrary values for all of the other columns as needed.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Save**.

For more information about how to set up carriers, see [Set up shipping carriers](../transportation/tasks/set-up-shipping-carriers.md).

#### Set up carrier service accounts

Set up a carrier service account by doing the following:

1. Go to **Transportation management \> Setup \> Rating \> Carrier service account**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **New** to add a new carrier service account.
1. Make the following settings for the new account:
    - **Shipping Carrier** â€“ *Demo Carrier*
    - **Carrier service** - *Demo carrier service*
    - **Carrier customer account number** - Enter the carrier customer account number used to verify and authenticate the connection to shipping carrier. Your carrier will provide this for you. (If you are using the demo service, you can enter an arbitrary value here.)
    - **Site** - *6*
    - **Warehouse** - *62*

    > [!NOTE]
    > Often, **Carrier customer account number** is the only setting required to authenticate the connection. However, if your carrier requires additional authentication parameters, your organization should customize this page to add the extra fields as needed.

#### Set up a container packing policy

Set up a container packing policy by doing the following:

1. If you haven't already done so, set up a ZPL printer definition using the Document Routing Agent application. For more information, see [Document printing overview](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/print-documents.md) and its related topics.
1. Go to **Warehouse Management \> Setup \> Containers \> Container packing policies**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **New** to add a new container packing policy.
1. In the header of the new policy, make the following settings:
    - **Container packing policy** - *Demo packing policy*.
    - **Description** - Enter a description of the policy.
1. On the **Overview** FastTab, make the following settings:
    - **Warehouse** - *62*
    - **Default location for final shipment** - *Baydoor*
    - **Weight unit** - *KG*
    - **Container closing policy** - *Automatic release*
    - **Container release policy** - *Make available at final shipping location*
1. On the **Container manifest** FastTab, make the following settings:

1. On the **Carrier label printing** FastTab, make the following settings:
    - **Print container shipping label** - *Always*
    - **Printer name** - Set to the name of the ZPL printer where you want to print shipping labels.


#### Set up a packing profile

Set up a packing profile by doing the following:

1. Go to **Warehouse Management \> Setup \> Packing \> Packing profiles**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **New** to add a new packing profile to the grid.
1. Make the following settings for the new profile:
    - **Packing profile ID** - *Demo packing profile*.
    - **Description** - Enter a description of the profile.
    - **Container packing policy** - *Demo packing policy*.
    - **Container ID mode** - *Auto*.
    - **Container type** - *SmallBox*

#### Set up a customer to use the SPS carrier

Now set up a customer to use carrier that you created for the example scenario. Do the following:

1. Go to **Accounts receivable \> customers \> All customers**.
1. Find and select customer *US-027* in the grid.
1. On the Action Pane, open the **General** tab and, from the **Set up** group, select **Carrier customer accounts**.
1. The **Carrier customer accounts** page opens. On the Action Pane, select **New** to add a new account to the grid.
1. Make the following settings for the new account:
    - **Shipping carrier** - *Demo Carrier*.
    - **Carrier customer account number** - *12345* (the value isn't important for this scenario, but we will refer to it later.).

### Walk through the example scenario

Once you have set up all of the sample data, as described in the previous section, you are ready to work through the example scenario provided here.

#### Create a sales order and process the work

Create a new sales order by doing the following:

1. Go to **Sales and marketing \> Sales orders \> All sales orders**.
1. Select **New** to create a sales order.
1. In the **Create sales order** dialog box, set the **Customer account** to *US-027*.
1. Select **OK** to create the new sales order and close the dialog box.
1. Your new sales order opens. On the **Sales order header** FastTab, set the **Carrier customer account number** to the value you selected for this customer (*12345*).
1. In the **Sales order lines** section, add a sales line with the following settings:
    - **Item number** - *A0002*
    - **Quantity** - *1*
    - **Site** - *6*
    - **Warehouse** - *62*
1. Open the **Header** tab at the top-right of the page.
1. On the **Delivery** FastTab, make the following settings:
    - **Shipping carrier** - *Demo Carrier*.
    - **Carrier service** - *Demo carrier service*
1. Open the **Lines** tab at the top-right of the page. If you're asked to update the mode of delver of the sales lines, select **Yes**.
1. In the **Sales order lines** section, select the order line you set up previously and, from the toolbar, select **Inventory \> Reservation**.
1. On the **Reservation** page, select **Reserve lot** to reserve the selected line's full quantity in the warehouse.
1. Close the **Reservation** page to return to the sales order.
1. On the Action Pane, open the **Warehouse** tab and select **Release to warehouse**.
1. Work is now created to move items from the picking location to the pack station.
1. In the **Sales order lines** section, select **Warehouse \> Shipment details**.  Make a note of the Shipment ID from this page - it will be needed later in the packing station.  You can close the shipment form.
1. Take a note of your sales order number and then go to **Warehouse management \> Work \> All work**.
1. Referring to the sales order number you noted previously, select the work created for the order.
1. On the Action Pane, open the **Work** tab and then select **Complete work**.
1. The **Work completion** page opens. Select a **User ID** and then, on the Action Pane, select **Validate work**.
1. Provided the work passes validation (it should), on the Action Pane, select **Complete work**.
1. The work is marked as completed, which simulates moving your items to the packing station.

#### Pack the shipment

Pack the shipment by doing the following:

1. Make sure that your user account is associated with a worker account for warehouse management. You can do this by going to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Worker**.

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Picking and containerization \> Pack**.
1. The **Select packing station** dialog box opens. Make the following settings here:
    - **Site** â€“ *6*
    - **Warehouse** - *62*
    - **Location** - *Pack*
    - **Packing profile ID** - *Demo packing profile*
1. Select **OK**.
1. The **Pack** page opens. In a production scenario, a worker would now scan a license plate or shipment ID. For this scenario, go to the **All shipments** page and look up the shipment number for the shipment you just created or use the Shipment ID previously noted. Enter this number into the **License plate or shipment** field.
1. On the Action Pane, select **New container**.
1. A dialog box opens showing details about the new container. Leave the default values and select **OK**.
1. You return to the **Pack** page. On the **Item packing** FastTab, select *A0002* from the **Identifier** drop-down list to pack that item. The item is then added to the container.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Containers for shipment**.
1. The **Containers for shipment** page opens. It shows a row for the container you just created, but its **Container manifest ID** is currently empty. This is because we didn't yet receive the label and tracking number from the carrier.
1. On the Action Pane, select **Close container**.
1. The **Close container** dialog box opens. Set the **Gross weight** to *1 kg* and select **OK**.
1. Your label should now print on the ZPL printer you selected previously. It should resemble the following example:  
    ![Example shipping label](media/sps-label-example.png "Example shipping label")
1. Note that the **Container manifest ID** and **Total freight** have now been added as received from the carrier.

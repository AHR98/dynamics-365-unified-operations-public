# Putaway clusters

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Putaway clusters are a way to pick multiple license plates at once and take them for putaway at different locations. It can be very useful for retail businesses, where license plates typically aren't full pallets of inventory. This process is often called a *Milk run*.

## Enable the Cluster Putaway feature

Before you can use this feature, it must be enabled on your system. Administrators can use the [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) page to check the feature status and enable it if needed. Here, the feature is listed as:

- **Module** - *Warehouse management*
- **Feature name** - *Cluster Putaway Feature*

## Setup for the example scenario

### Cluster profiles

The Putaway cluster profile determines where the item will go based on the location assigned to the item at receipt. If different clusters are needed, different Putaway clusters should be created, one for each mobile device menu item.

1. Go to **Advanced Warehouse management \> Setup \> Mobile device \> Cluster profiles**.
1. Select **New** in the Action Pane.
1. In the **Header**, enter the following:

    - **Putaway Cluster profile ID** – *Cluster putaway*
    - **Putaway Cluster profile ID Name** – *Cluster putaway*
    - **Cluster type** – *Putaway*
    - **Sequence number** - *Accept default*

1. Select **Save** to enable the required fields on the **General** FastTab.
1. On the **General** FastTab, specify the following:

    - **Cluster assignment timing** - *At receipt*
        - Should the putaway cluster be assigned immediately when the inventory is being received, or sorted later?

    - **Cluster assignment rule** - *Manual*
        - Should the cluster assignment be determined automatically by the system, or manually by the user?

    - **Directive code** - *Leave blank*
    - **Putaway cluster locate** - *Receipt*
        - **Receipt**: Location found immediately during receipt.
        - **Cluster close**: Location found when cluster is closed.
        - **User directed**: Location found when LP is picked from cluster to putaway.
            - The putaway work is created without location and during the putaway itself, the user has to scan the LP or Work ID to initiate the Put step. The system finds the put location again and tells the user where to put the picked quantity.

    - **Putaway cluster per user** – *No*
        - When assigning clusters automatically, should each cluster be unique per user? Only enabled when **Cluster assignment rule** is set to *Automatic*.

    - **Unit restriction** - *Leave blank*
        - Unit that is required to be received for the profile to valid. If left blank, all units will be valid.

    - **Work unit break** – *Individual*
        - When closing a cluster, should all inventory be consolidated onto one license plate (using the cluster ID and the LP), and putaway as a single LP, or putaway separately on the LPs that were received? Disabled when **Putaway cluster locate** is set to *Receipt*.

    - **Cluster persists as Parent License Plate** – *No*
        - If *Yes*, when the Put step is complete, the Cluster ID will become a Parent License Plate and all items on the Cluster ID will be tied to that Parent license plate.

1. On the **Cluster sorting** FastTab, putaway sorting criteria can be determined. Select **New** in the Toolbar and enter the following:

    - **Sequence number** – *Accept default*
    - **Field name** – *WMSLocationId*
        - Determines what field this line will use for sorting criteria.

    - **Sorting** – *Ascending*
        - Determines whether sorting should be Ascending or Descending.

1. On the **Cluster work template** FastTab, select **New** in the Toolbar to add a line. Enter the following:
    - **Work order type** - *Purchase orders* : **Work template** - *61 PO Direct*

1. In the Action Pane, select **Save**, then select **Edit query**.
1. In the **Cluster putaway** dialog box, on the **Range** tab, select **Add** to add a second line to the query, then update the query lines as follows:

    | Table | Derived table | Field | Criteria |
    | -- | -- | -- | -- |
    | Work | Work | Warehouse | 61 |
    | Work | Work | Work ID | *Leave blank* |

10. Select **OK** to save the query and close the dialog box.
1. Select **Save** in the Action Pane and exit the form.

### Mobile device menu items

Three new mobile device menu items are available for this functionality. *Menu item 1* is used to sort the received inventory to a putaway cluster upon receipt. *Menu item 2* is used to assign multiple license plates to a cluster for putaway. *Menu item 3* is used to put away the cluster once it has been assigned.

    - Item **A0002** with a quantity of **20**
    - Item **M9215** with a quantity of **30**

#### Close cluster

Before the items in the cluster can be put away, the cluster must first be closed. The following steps will be completed in Supply Chain Management.

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Work \> Outbound \> Work clusters**.
1. In the **Work cluster** section of the page, search the **Cluster ID** field for the cluster ID entered previously.
1. If the cluster is not displayed, it may have already been closed. To verify this, select the **Show closed work** check box, and search from the cluster ID entered previously.

    - If the cluster has been closed go to **Cluster putaway** section below.
    - If the cluster has not been closed, the following steps describe how to manually close the cluster.

1. From the **Work clusters** page, in the **Work cluster** section, select the cluster ID created previously.
1. In the Action Pane, select **Close cluster**.
1. When the cluster has been closed it will no longer be displayed in the **Work cluster** section (with **Show closed work** unselected).

#### Cluster putaway

The following steps will be performed on the mobile device.

1. Logon to the mobile device with a user setup for warehouse 61.
1. Select **Inbound** from the **MAIN MENU**.
1. Select **Cluster putaway** from the **INBOUND** menu.
1. Select **CLUSTER ID** and enter the closed cluster ID created previously.
1. Select **OK**.
1. The **Cluster putaway: Pick** screen is displayed.

    - The **Cluster ID** is displayed along with the picking location (**Loc**), items (**Multiple** will be displayed) and total quantity (**Total Qty**) in the cluster to be picked.

1. Select **OK**.
1. The **Cluster putaway: Put** screen is displayed.

    - The **Put** instructions identify the cluster ID, the put location, items, quantity as well as the license plate ID's for the items received on the cluster.
    - The user has the standard option to **Override** or **Pass** this step.

9. Select **OK** to confirm the putaway of the cluster.
1. The message **Cluster Completed** will be displayed.

## Notes and tips

- For the instances where the Cluster ID becomes the Parent LP for a nested pallet, when the Cluster ID is scanned, the Put position is automatically given and no further LP needs to be scanned, even if generating LP is set to be manual.

### Assign to Putaway Cluster

If **Assign putaway cluster** is marked *No* on the **Receive and Sort Cluster** mobile device menu item, the step to assign the receipt to a putaway cluster is manual. The scenario applied here does not use this menu item. Listed below are steps to manually assign to a putaway cluster.

1. Logon to the mobile device with a user setup for warehouse 61.
1. Select **Inbound** from the **MAIN MENU**.
1. Select **Assign Cluster** from the **INBOUND** menu.
1. Enter the Cluster ID (or have the system generate one automatically).
1. Add previously created Work IDs/License plates to the Cluster. Repeat for all Work IDs.
    - The user will see a message on the mobile device _"Work was assigned to cluster"_
1. After the last Work has been added to the Cluster, initiate the _Close Cluster._ The user will be presented with the message _"Cluster Close Successfully"_.
    - Unlike outbound cluster picking, Putaway Clusters do not have maximum number of positions assigned. The user can decide when to close the Cluster manually.

This Cluster is now ready for putaway processing.

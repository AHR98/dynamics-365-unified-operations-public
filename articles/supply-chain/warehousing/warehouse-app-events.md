# Warehouse app event processing

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]


This feature adds a queue for processing events issued by the warehouse app. Batch jobs running in Supply Chain Management can use data from this queue to react as needed to the signaled events. The warehouse app adds relevant events to the queue in response to certain types of actions taken by workers using the app.
An example is when using the feature **Create and process transfer orders from the warehouse app** where the transfer order header and lines gets created and updated in the back end when the system is running the **Process warehouse app events** batch job.

## Enable the Process warehouse app events feature

Before you can use this feature, it must be enabled on your system. Administrators can use the [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) page to check the feature status and enable it if needed. Here, the feature is listed as:

- **Module** - Warehouse management
- **Feature name** - Process warehouse app events

## Set up a batch job to process warehouse app events

### Process warehouse app events

Set up a scheduled batch job to process the warehouse app events for the transfer order creation and line updates.
1.	Go to **Warehouse management \> Periodic tasks \> Process warehouse app events**.
2.	The Process warehouse app events dialog box opens. Expand the **Run in background** FastTab and set **Batch processing** to **Yes**.
3.	On the **Run in the background** FastTab, select **Recurrence**.
4.	The **Define recurrence** dialog box opens. Set the run schedule as needed for your business.
5.	Select **OK** to return to the **Process warehouse app events** dialog box.
6.	Select **OK** on the **Process warehouse app events** dialog box to add the batch job to the batch queue.

## Inquire the warehouse app events
You can view the event queue and events messages generated by the warehouse app by going to **Warehouse management \> Inquiries and reports \> Mobile device logs \> Warehouse app events**. 

## The standard event queue process
The warehouse apps events queue will typically be used with the following described flow:

1.	An event gets added to the queue  with an event message. The new message initially has an Event state of **Waiting**, which means that the **Process warehouse app events** batch job will not pick up and process this message yet.
2.	As soon as the message state get updated to **Queued** the **Process warehouse app** events batch job will pick up and process the event.
5.	The batch job updates the event states to either **Completed** or **Failed** depending on whether the requested process was possible or not. 
6.	When all the related event messages are **Completed** the event get deleted from the queue.

 For a specific example you can read about the [Create transfer order from warehouse app process](create-transfer-order-from-warehouse-app.md).


## Handle event errors
As part of the warehouse event processing, it might happen that the requested message activity cannot get processes by the batch job. In this case the event message will get updated to **Failed** and you can use the **Batch log** information to read why and take action to correct any problems.
You can see an example for the process for using the [Create transfer order from warehouse app ](create-transfer-order-from-warehouse-app.md).

To reset a failed warehouse app event message:
1.	Go to the **Warehouse management \> Inquiries and reports \> Mobile device logs \> Warehouse app events.
2.	On the **Warehouse app event messages** FastTab, find and select a relevant event that is showing **Failed** in the **Event state** column.
3.	Select **Reset** from the **Warehouse app event messages** toolbar.
4.	Continue working until all relevant messages are reset.

Another way to remove a **Failed** event message is to use the **Delete** option from the **Warehouse app event messages** toolbar.

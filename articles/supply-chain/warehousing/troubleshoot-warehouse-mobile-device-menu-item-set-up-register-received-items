# Troubleshoot warehouse mobile device menu item set up to register received items

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to fix common issues that you might encounter while you set up mobile device menu items for registration of inbound orders in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

## I get the error "The quantity is not valid" when registering inbound orders.

### Issue description

When **License plate grouping policy** *User defined* is set on the mobile decive menu item used to register inbound orders, I get the error "The quantity is not valid" and I am unable to complete the registration.

### Issue cause

When using *User defined* as a **License plate grouping policy** the system will split the incoming inventory into separate license plates as indicated by the unit sequence group. If batch or serial numbers are used to track the item being received, the quantities of each batch or serial must be specified per license plate registered. If the quantity specified for a license plate is greater than the quantity left to receive for the current dimensions, the above error will be shown.

### Issue resolution

When registering an item using a mobile device menu item that has **License plate grouping policy** set to *User defined* the system may require you to confirm or input license plate numbers, batch numbers, or serial numbers. For the license plate confirmation screen the system will display the quantity alocated for the current license plate.

For batch or serial confirmation screens the system will display the *quantity left to receive* on the current license plate and an input for the quantity to be registered with the current license plate, and batch or serial number. In this case, ensure that the quantity being registered for the license plate is not greater than the *quantity left to receive*. 

Alternatively, if too many license plates are being generated on inbound order registration, the **License plate grouping policy** may be changed to *License plate grouping*, or a new **Unit sequence group** may be assigned to the item, or the **License plate grouping** option in the **Unit sequence group** may be deactivated.

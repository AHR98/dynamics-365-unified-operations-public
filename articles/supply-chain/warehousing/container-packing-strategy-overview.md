# Container packing strategy overview

A *container packing strategy* is a strategy that you can use to define item allocations across the containers. This topic explains the difference between the *Pack into all open containers* and *Pack into current container only* strategies.  

The *Pack into all open containers* strategy indicates that the system must check all open containers that have already been created during the containerization cycle to make sure that the items will fit in any of them. During packing, the system checks each item to see whether it will fit into any of the already created containers. If the item won't fit into an existing container, the system creates a new container and continues until it completes packing the entire order. For example, suppose there are *n* ordered items that require containerization. In the worst case, each time the system processes an item that doesn't fit into any existing container, the system will perform (((n-1) Ã— (n+1)) / 2) checks in total to evaluate whether it fits into the existing containers.

The *Pack into current container only* strategy indicates that the system must check the most recently created container to make sure that the item will fit into that container. During packing, the system checks each item to see whether it will fit in the most recently created container. If the item won't fit into that container, the system creates a new container and continues until it completes packing the entire order. For example, suppose there are *n* ordered items that require containerization. In the worst case, the system will perform (n-1) checks in total to evaluate whether it fits into the containers.

## Example of the container packing strategy flow

For this example, suppose you are setting up items for the containerization with the following physical dimensions:

| Item | Physical dimensions (Width, Depth, Height)  | Weight  |
|---|---|---|
| HDMI Cable 6' | 1 x 1 x 1 | 1 |
| HDMI Cable 12' | 2 x 1 x 1 |1 |
| HDMI Cable 18' | 3 x 1 x 1 |2 |

You are setting up a box that will be used for packaging with the following physical dimensions:

| Container |Physical dimensions (Length, Width, Height) | Weight  | Volume|
|---|---|---|---|
| Medium Box | 6 x 3 x 2 | 10 | 100 |

You are setting up an order that contains the following products and quantities:

| Sales order line | Quantity  |
|---|---|
| HDMI Cable 12' | 9 |
| HDMI Cable 18' | 8 |
| HDMI Cable 6' | 13 |

The following table summarizes how containerization works when you use *Pack into all open containers* and when you use *Pack into current container only*.

| Pack into all open containers | Pack into current container |
|---|----|
| HDMI Cable 12': <ul><li>Create new container CONT0001.</li> <li>Place 9 ea into container CONT0001</li></ul>|HDMI Cable 12':<ul><li>Create a new container CONT0001.</li> <li>Place 9 ea into container CONT0001.</li></ul>|
|HDMI Cable 18': <ul><li> Check if item can fit container CONT0001.</li><li>Create new container CONT0002.</li> <li>Place 5 ea into container CONT0002.</li><li>Create new container CONT0003.</li> <li>Place 3 ea into container CONT0003.</li></ul> |HDMI Cable 18': <ul><li> Check if item can fit container CONT0001.</li><li>Create new container CONT0002.</li> <li>Place 5 ea into container CONT0002.</li><li>Create new container CONT0003.</li> <li>Place 3 ea into container CONT0003.</li></ul>|
|HDMI Cable 6': <ul><li> Check if item can fit container CONT0001.</li><li>Place 1 ea into container CONT0001.</li><li>Check if item can fit container CONT0002.</li><li>Check if item can fit container CONT0003.</li><li>Place 4 ea into container CONT0003.</li><li>Create new container CONT0004.</li><li>Place 8 ea into container CONT0004.</li></ul> |HDMI Cable 6':<ul><li> Check if item can fit container CONT0003.</li><li>Place 4 ea into container CONT0003.</li><li>Create new container CONT0004.</li><li>Place 9 ea into container CONT0004.</li></ul> |

## Example scenario: Pack single orders per container

This section presents a scenario where the system is set to  consolidation of multiple orders into one shipment, so we will containerize from the sales order to ensure that each single order, which contains multiple products, is packed in its own container.

This functionality lets you handle scenarios where you must pack only one sales order into each container, thereby making it possible for the distribution center to cross dock full containers between retail stores. In addition to the retail scenarios (order per retail store, shipping to a distribution center for cross docking) this technique is also commonly used in lean supply chains (sales order per just-in-time production line).

This scenario illustrates how you could containerize using the *Pack into current container only* strategy to decrease the number of containers that are evaluated during packing.

### Prerequisites

#### Enable the Consolidate shipments feature on your system

This scenario makes use of the *Consolidate shipments* feature, which you must enable using [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) if it isn't already available on your system.

#### Make demo data available

This scenario references values and records that are included in the standard demo data that is provided for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management. If you want to use the values that are provided here as you do the exercises, be sure to work in an environment where the demo data is installed, and set the legal entity to **USMF** before you begin.

### Inspect or create container types

To inspect your container types, and create new ones if needed, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Warehouse management** \> **Setup** \> **Containers** \> **Container types**.

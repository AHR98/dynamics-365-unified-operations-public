# Create transfer orders from the warehouse app

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This feature lets warehouse workers create and process transfer orders directly from the warehouse app. The warehouse workers start by selecting the destination warehouse and can following scan one or more license plates using the app.
When the warehouse worker selects the **Complete order** a batch job will create the required transfer order and order lines based on the on-hand inventory registered for those license plates.

## <a name="enable-create-transfer-order-from-warehouse-app"></a>Enable the create transfer orders from Warehouse app feature

Before you can use this feature, it must be enabled on your system. Administrators can use the [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) page to check the feature status and enable it if needed. Here, the feature is listed as:

- **Module** - Warehouse management
- **Feature name** - Create and process transfer orders from the warehouse app 

The feature is dependent on having the feature [Process warehouse app events](warehouse-app-events.md) enabled.

### <a name="setup-warehouse-app-menu"></a>Set up a mobile device menu item to create transfer orders

1. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Mobile device \> Mobile device menu items**.
2. Select **New** to add a new menu item. Then make the following settings to get started:
    - Menu item name - Assign a name as it should appear in Supply Chain Management
    - Title - Assign a menu name as it should be presented to workers in the warehouse app.
    - Mode - Set to **Indirect** (this warehouse app will not create work)
    - Activity code - Set to **Create transfer order from license plates** to enable the warehouse workers to create a transfer order based on one or more scanned license plates.
3. Use the **Order line creation policy** setting to control how transfer order lines will be created by this menu item. The lines will get created/updated based on the on-hand inventory registered for the scanned license plates. Choose one of the following values:
    - **No reservation** - The transfer order lines will not get reserved.
    - **License plate guided with line reservation** â€“ The transfer order lines will get reserved and use the License plate guided strategy option, which stores the relevant license plate IDs associated with the order lines. Located license plate ID values can therefore be used as part of the work creation process for the transfer order lines.
4. Use the **Outbound shipment policy** setting to add more automation to the outbound transfer order shipment process, as needed. When a worker selects the **Complete order** button, the app creates the **Complete order** warehouse app event, which will save the value you choose here in the Outbound shipment policy field for each line in the current transfer order. Later, when the event queue is processed by a batch job to create the transfer order, the value stored in this field can be read by the batch job, and may therefore control how that job processes each line. Choose one of the following:
    - **None**
    - **Release to warehouse**
    - **Ship confirm**
    - **Release and ship confirm**
5. Go to **Warehouse management \> Setup \> Mobile device \> Mobile device menu**
9. Select Edit.
10.	Select a existing menu following selection of the new menu item under **Available menus and menu items**. Add the menu item into by clicking the "->".

### Create transfer order from license plates processing
The warehouse app processing has a very simple main process flow consisting of:
1. Create transfer order - Identification of destination warehouse.
2. Repeatable identification of License plates going to get shipped.
3. **Complete order** indication via warehouse app menu button.
>[!Note]
> It is possible for multiple workers to assign license plates intended for the same transfer order by using the the **Select transfer order** button to select an existing, unprocessed, transfer order number from the warehouse app event queue. For information about how to find the transfer order number values, see [Inquire the warehouse app events](#inquire-the-warehouse-app-events).

# Example scenario using the feature in an automated way
You will get an overview of process of getting transfer orders created and automatically outbound processed based on the on-hand inventory registered on license plates.

To work through this scenario using the values suggested, you must work on a system with demo data installed and select the USMF legal entity before you begin.

It is assumed that you already have enabled the feature [Enable the create transfer orders from Warehouse app](#enable-create-transfer-order-from-warehouse-app), including the [Warehouse app event processing](warehouse-app-events.md) capability.

## Example Scenario blueprint
You are a retailer and have multiple license plates each containing a mix of items placed at a specific location within one of your warehouse **51**.
You would like to enable the process of creating a transfer order to another warehouse for all the license plates and automatically ship update the transfer order as soon as the last license plate for an order has been identified.

## Processing the example for "Create transfer order from the warehouse app"

### Add on-hand on a license plate

As a starting point for this scenario you will need to have a license plate containing physical available inventory on-hand.

| Item | Warehouse | Inventory status | Location | License plate | Quantity |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A0001 | 51 | Available | LP-010 | LP10 | 1 |
| A0002 | 51 | Available | LP-010 | LP10 | 2 |

Add physical inventory on-hand quantities by using the following values:

> [!NOTE]
> You will need to create the license plate and use locations which allows to carry mixed items, like LP-010.

### Create and process transfer orders from the warehouse app

1. Open the app and login as user **_51_**. Current user warehouse will be 51.
2. Select the menu item **_Create TO_**.
3. Create transfer order by selecting to-warehouse **_61_** in the **Warehouse** field. The new transfer order will be going from current warehouse 51 to destination warehouse 61.
4. Scan a license plate **_LP10_** into the **License plate** field to add the license plate to the transfer order.
5. Click on the menu button and select **Complete order** to finalize the warehouse app transfer order creation.

For the above-mentioned example two **Warehouse app events** (**_Create transfer order_** and **_Complete transfer order_**) gets used.

###  <a name="#inquire-the-warehouse-app-events"></a>Inquire the warehouse app events
You can view the event queue and events messages generated by the warehouse app by going to **Warehouse management \> Inquiries and reports \> Mobile device logs \> Warehouse app events**. 

The **_Create transfer order_** event messages will get created in the status **Waiting** which means that the **Process warehouse app events** batch job will not pick-up and process the event messages. As soon as the event messages gets updates to status **Queued** the batch job will process the events. This will happen at the same time as the creation of the **_Complete transfer order_** event (**Complete order** button click). When the **_Create transfer order_** event messages has been processed the status gets updated to **Completed** or **Failed**. When the **_Complete transfer order_** status gets updated to **Completed,** all the related events gets deleted from the queue.

Because the **Warehouse app events** for the creation of transfer order data will not get processed by the batch job before the messages gets updated into status **Queued** , you will need to look-up the requested transfer order numbers as part of the **Identifier** field.

As part of the warehouse event processing it might happen that the creation of the transfer order lines fails. In this case the state of the event message will get updated to **Failed** and you can use the **Batch log** information to read why and use take action to correct any problems.

Typical issues could be related to missing setup for the process, like e.g. a missing transit warehouse for the **_Create transfer order_** event. In an example like this this, you would simply add a transit warehouse to the shipping warehouse and change the status for all the warehouse app event messages via the **Reset** option from **Failed** into **Queued** which will mean that the batch job will process the event messages again after the correction of the setup data.

Within production environments, the exceptions would of cause be more process related, like e.g. having a requested license plate which at the batch job processing time is empty and thereby no transfer order lines can get created. This failed event message can either be removed by using the **Delete** option or you can add the needed physical on-hand on the license plate and use the **Reset** option for all the related event messages.

More information can be found here: [Warehouse app event processing](warehouse-app-events.md).

### Follow up on the example scenario processing

The follwing happend in the scenario:

1. Using the warehouse app, you selected a menu item that uses the activity code **Create transfer order from license plates**.
2. The app prompted you to select the destination warehouse for the transfer order. The source warehouse is always the one you currently are operating against.
3. On the selection of the destination warehouse, the system reserved an ID number for the upcoming transfer order (based on the transfer-order number sequence defined on your system) but did not create the transfer order yet.
4. When you scanned the license plate **_LP10_** containing on-hand inventory that should be moved to the new warehouse an **Warehouse app event** was added to the events queue to be processed later. The warehouse event contained message details about the scan, including the intended transfer-order number.
6. At warehouse app **Complete order** button click a new warehouse app event got created and the relate existing event changed status to **Queued**.
7. On the back end the **Process warehouse app events batch job** did now pick-up the **Queued** event and collected the on-hand related to the scanned license plate. Based on the on-hand the actual transfer order record and associated lines got created. The job also populated the **Outbound shipment policy** field for the transfer order with the value based to configured **_Release and ship confirm_** and linked the license plate against the lines for the **License plate guided** strategy.
8. Based on the transfer order line **Outbound shipment policy** field value the **Automatic release of transfer orders batch job** query now resulted in releasing the transfer order to the shipping warehouse. And due to the setup for the used **Wave template**, **Work template**, and **Location directives** the work got auto processes resulting on the **Load status** got updated to **_Loaded_**.
9. The **Process outbound shipment batch job** now got executed for the load resulting in the transfer order getting shipped and thereby the Advance Shipment Notice (ASN) to get generated.

- **Location** - *SHORT-01*
- **Location profile ID** - *Short Storage*

## Process

### Containerization (packing)

1. Go to **Sales and marketing \> Sales orders \> All sales orders**.
1. On the Action Pane, select **New**.
1. In the **Create sales order** dialog box, set the following values:

    - **Customer account:** *US-001*
    - **Warehouse:** *63*

1. Select **OK** to create the sales order and close the dialog box.
1. The new sales order is opened. It should include a new, empty line in the grid on the **Sales order lines** FastTab. On this line, set the following values:

    - **Item number:** *A0001*
    - **Quantity:** *1*

1. On the **Sales order lines** FastTab toolbar, select **Inventory \> Reservation**.
1. On the **Reservation** page, on the Action Pane, select **Reserve lot** to reserve the inventory.
1. Close the page.
1. On the Action Pane, open the **Warehouse** tab and select **Release to warehouse** to create work for the warehouse.
1. On the **Sales order lines** FastTab toolbar, select **Warehouse \> Shipment details**.
1. On the Action Pane, open the **Transportation** tab and select **View containers**. Confirm that the item was containerized into the *Short Box* container.

This process used the *Packing* type dimensions, for which the height is less than 3.

### Storage

1. Open the mobile device, sign in to warehouse 63 and go to **Inventory \> Adjust In**.
1. Enter Loc = SHORT-01, make up a new LP, Item = A0001, and quantity = 1 pcs.
1. Select **OK**. You will receive the error "Location SHORT-01 failed because item A0001 does not fit in location's specified dimensions." This is because the *Storage* type dimensions of the product are larger than the dimensions specified on the location profile.

Transportation Management Miscellaneous Charge
----------------------------------------------

Transportation generated charges must as any miscellaneous charge be associated
with a charge code. Unless this association is done, a charge will not be added
back to the order as a miscellaneous charge. The charge code determines how the
charge is accounted for relative to the order and order line to which it is
added.

In this form it is possible to define qualifying criteria for when a specific
charge code is applied to a charge.

There should be at least one setup for each direction (customer/vendor) where
the miscellaneous charge type is set to None. If this is missing, the
Miscellaneous Charge will NOT get added to the order.

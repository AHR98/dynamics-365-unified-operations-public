# Transportation management zone master

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Transport management allows you divide geograohic locations into zones. Dividing locations into zone can help with simplified Transportation pricing, optimized load planning, and optimized route planning.  
Simplified Transportation pricing – Zone-wise pricing can be  simpler than individual location-based pricing especially when transportation locations are scattered.
Optimized Load Planning – by consolidating loads by zones. 
Optimized Route Planning – by assigning specific route plans to specific zones.

The definition of a zone is user-defined based on the meta data fields to qualify a zone (such as Country, Zip code range, carrier service)
Zone Definition is not required if transportation pricing does not employ a Zone concept.

Transportation Management Discounts
===================================

Within Transportation management you can setup discounts to be applied on top of
the transportation price calculated by the rating engine. A discount given
either as a % of charges calculated or as a fixed amount.

Importantly working with transportation discounts enable you to define whether
to pass on the discount to the end customer , by choosing discount type
customer, or to retain it in the company, by choosing discount type shipper.
This enables you to define a setup by which you earn a margin on the freight
charge calculated.

The discount can be setup using multiple qualifiers such as carrier, carrier
service, delivery terms, customer, destination, and more.

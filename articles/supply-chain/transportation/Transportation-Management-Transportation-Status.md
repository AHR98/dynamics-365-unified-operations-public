Transportation Management status
================================

You can set up master codes for transportation statuses to interpret codes that
are provided by your shipping carriers. This method is used for integration with
shipping carriers to provide a status. The transportation status that you
provide for a transportation master status code can help you track the status of
a load, shipment, or container. The specific transportation status for a load,
shipment, or container can only be updated through data integration and not
manually through the UI.

Transportation Management Modes and Methods
===========================================

The mode represents the type of transport that the carrier uses for freight
deliveries. Examples hereof are Less than load (LTL), Truckload (TL), or Parcel.
The transportation method represents the form of transport that the carrier uses
for freight deliveries, such as air, ground, ocean, or rail.

Modes and Transportation Methods are used in several contexts. Only Modes are
used in route plans, while both Modes and Transportation Methods are used in
when setting up shipping carriers and carrier services. No explicit relationship
or hierarchy exists between mode and transportation methods.

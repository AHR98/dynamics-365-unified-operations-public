# Supply and demand forecast

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to view and create inventory forecasts. You can create and view supply and demand forecast lines for items, item groups, item allocation keys, customer accounts, customer groups, vendor accounts, and vendor groups.

For each forecast line, you can select the forecast model to use and then specify the item or item group plus the quantity or the transaction amount. You can also set up a time schedule for allocating the forecast quantity.

<!-- KFM: Let's add a mention here about the inventory forecast. -->

## View and enter forecast lines manually
<!-- KFM: How else can a forecast be created, besides "manually"? Is there also an automatic way? If so, mention it here or add a new section that briefly describes how it works. -->

Use this procedure to create new forecast lines for products. You can refer to the information in the table below on other ways to access these pages (instead of the first two steps).

1. Depending on which type of entity you want to create a forecast for, and which type of forecast you want to create, open a supply, demand, or inventory forecast page as described in the following table.
    | **Entity** | **Instructions** |
    | --- | --- |
    | Released products | <ol><li>Go to  **Product information management > Products > Released products**.</li><li>Select the product you want to create a forecast for.</li><li>On the Action Pane, open the **Plan** tab and, from the **Forecast** group, select **Demand forecast**,  **Supply forecast**, or **Inventory forecast** depending on which type of forecast you want to work with.</li></ol> |
    | Released product variants | <ol><li>Go to  **Product information management > Products > Released product variants**.</li><li>Select the variant you want to create a forecast for.</li><li>On the Action Pane, open the **Plan** tab and, from the **Forecast** group, select **Demand forecast**,  **Supply forecast**, or **Inventory forecast** depending on which type of forecast you want to work with.</li></ol> |
    | Item groups | <ol><li>Go to **Inventory management > Setup > Inventory > Item groups**.</li><li>Select the item group you want to create a forecast for.</li><li>On the Action Pane, select **Forecasting \> Demand**,  **Forecasting \> Supply**, or **Forecasting \> Inventory forecast**, depending on which type of forecast you want to work with.</li></ol> |
    | Item allocation keys | <ol><li>Go to **Inventory management > Setup > Forecast**.</li><li>Select the item allocation key you want to create a forecast for.</li><li>On the Action Pane, select **Demand forecast**.</li></ol> |
    | Customers | <ol><li>Go to **Master planning > Forecasting > Manual forecast entry > Customers**.</li><li>Select the customer you want to create a forecast for.</li><li>On the Action Pane, select **Define demand forecast**.</li></ol> |
    | Customer groups | <ol><li>Go to **Master planning > Forecasting > Manual forecast entry > Customer groups**.</li><li>Select the customer group you want to create a forecast for.</li><li>On the Action Pane, select **Define demand forecast**.</li></ol> |
    | Vendors | <ol><li>Go to **Master planning > Forecasting > Manual forecast entry > Vendors**.</li><li>Select the vendor you want to create a forecast for.</li><li>On the Action Pane, select **Entry** to open the **Supply forecast**  page.</li></ol> |
    | Vendor groups | <ol><li>Go to **Master planning > Forecasting > Manual forecast entry > Vendor groups**.</li><li>Select the vendor group you want to create a forecast for.</li><li>On the Action Pane, select **Entry** to open the **Supply forecast**  page.</li></ol> | <!-- KFM: We can also open **Master planning \> Forecasting \> Demand forecast lines** and **Master planning \> Forecasting \> Demand forecast lines** directly. I suppose they show forecast lines for all entities and records. Shouldn't we also describe those in this table? -->
1. Depending on your selection, the **Supply forecast** or **Demand forecast** page opens, showing any existing forecast lines for the record you selected before opening the page.
1. Select **New** from the Action pane to add a new forecast line to the top grid.
1. For the new line, select the forecast **Model** to use, and then enter other details as needed, such as the item, item group, customer/vendor account or group, item quantity, or total transaction amount. See the later sections in this topic for complete details about each of the settings available on these pages.
1. To distribute the entered forecast over the period, select **Allocate forecast** from the toolbar on the **Overview** tab.
1. Use the **Allocation** grid to review the time horizon and the time intervals that are used to distribute the forecast quantities.

## Supply forecast lines

The supply forecast lets you create a plan for items to be purchased. It tells procurement and sourcing clerks what they are expected to order.

You can enter supply forecast by item, item group, item allocation key, vendor, and vendor group. See [Enter forecast lines manually](#manual-entry) for details about all the ways to open the **Supply forecast** page for various entities and records.

The **Supply forecast** page provides a grid of supply forecast lines at the top and an **Allocation** grid at the bottom.

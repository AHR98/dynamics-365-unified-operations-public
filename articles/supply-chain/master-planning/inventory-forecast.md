# Supply and demand forecast

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes the functionality that can be used to create inventory forecast in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management.

This functionality allows to create and view supply and demand forecast lines, respectively, for items, item groups, item allocation keys, customer accounts, customer groups, vendor accounts, and vendor groups.

For each forecast line, you can select the forecast model to use and then specify the item/item group plus the quantity or the transaction amount. You can also set up a time schedule for allocating the forecast quantity.

## Supply forecast
The supply forecast allows you to create a plan for items to be purchased. The supply forecast is used to help the procurement and sourcing clerks by showing them what is expected to order.

Supply forecast can be entered by item, item group, item allocation key, vendor, and vendor group.

The page contains the following fields:

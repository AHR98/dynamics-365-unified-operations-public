# Net requirements and pegging information with built-in master planning

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

When you run master planning, it is important to comprehend its output and understand how existing supply covers the demand and why specific supply was generated. You can use the **Net requirements** page to better understand the calculated requirements that are the results of master planning.

The **Net requirements** page displays the net requirements calculated for the product during master planning. This page also shows the coverage settings that were applied during master planning, the breakdown of the requirements totals according to transaction type, and pegging information.

The **Net requirements** page works the same way regardless of whether you are using Planning Optimization or the built-in master planning engine. For details about how to work with it, see [Net requirements and pegging information with Planning Optimization](planning-optimization/net-requirements.md).

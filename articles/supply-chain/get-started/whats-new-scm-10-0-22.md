## Features included in this release

The following table lists the features included in this release. The *Feature* column provides links to the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features), where you can see the official release dates for each feature. The *More information* column provides more details and/or links to related documentation.

Most of these features must be enabled using [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) before you can use them. Some of the listed features are still in preview, while others may already be generally available.

| Feature area | Feature | More information |
|---|---|---|
| Manufacturing | [Face recognition sign-in for production floor workers](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/worker-sign-in-face-recognition-production-floor-execution-interface) |  |
| Planning | [Planning Optimization support for capability-based resource allocation](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planning-optimization-support-capability-based-resource-allocation) |  |

## Feature enhancements included in this release

The following table lists the feature enhancements included in this release. Each of these provides an incremental improvement to an existing feature. Because they are only enhancements, they are not listed in the [release plan](/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave2/finance-operations/dynamics365-supply-chain-management/planned-features). However, to ensure that these enhancements won't conflict with your existing customizations or preferences, each of them is turned off by default (unless otherwise noted). If you want to use any of these features, you must explicitly enable them in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

### Removed and deprecated Supply Chain Management features

The [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) topic describes features that have been or are scheduled to be removed or deprecated for Supply Chain Management.

- A *removed* feature is no longer available in the product.
- A *deprecated* feature is not in active development and may be removed in a future update.

Before any feature is removed from the product, the deprecation notice will be announced in the [Removed or deprecated features in Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management](removed-deprecated-features-scm-updates.md) topic 12 months prior to the removal.

For breaking changes that only affect compilation time, but are binary compatible with sandbox and production environments, the deprecation time will be less than 12 months. Typically, these are functional updates that need to be made to the compiler.

# Standard saved views for Supply Chain Management

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management includes several saved views that you can enable and use as needed. Some of these standard saved views are optimized and named for a specific role or task (for example, "Quality control" or "Receiving"). Others are optimized so that they include only the fields and settings that Microsoft usage statistics indicate are most often used by customers. These saved views are typically referred to as *simplified views*. This topic describes the standard saved views that are available, and explains how to enable and customize them.

For complete details about how to work with saved views, including the standard saved views, after you enable them, see [Saved views](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/saved-views.md?toc=/dynamics365/supply-chain/toc.json).

## Available saved views and how to enable them

To use the saved views feature, regardless of whether you will use the standard saved views, you must turn on the *Saved views* feature in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

The following table describes the standard saved views that are currently available. It shows the name of each saved view, the page where you can find it, and a description of it. The table also shows the name of the feature that includes the saved view. To see a standard saved view in your system, you must turn on the specified feature in [Feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## Customizing the standard saved views

You can customize the standard saved views, just as you can customize your own saved views. However, when you customize a standard saved view, we strongly recommend that you save your custom version under a new name. Otherwise, your customizations could be overwritten when you update Supply Chain Management.

For more information about how to customize and rename saved views, see [Saved views](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/saved-views.md?toc=/dynamics365/supply-chain/toc.json).

# Standard saved views for Supply Chain Management

Supply chain management includes several saved views that you can enable and use as needed. Some of them are optimized and named for a specific role or task (such as "Quality control" or "Receiving"), while others are optimized to include only those fields and settings that Microsoft usage statistics indicate are most often used by customers (these are typically called "Simplified" views). This topic describes each of the available saved views, how to enable them, and how to customize them.

For complete details about how to work with saved views, including the standard saved views once you have enabled them, see [Saved views](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/saved-views.md?toc=/dynamics365/supply-chain/toc.json).

## Available saved views and how to enable them

To use the saved views feature, with or without the standard saved views, you must enable the *Saved views* feature in [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

The following table lists and describes each of the standard saved views that is currently available. It lists the name of the view, the page where you can find it, a description of the view, and the name of the feature that includes it. To see a listed standard saved view on your system, its related feature must be enabled in [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) using the feature name listed in the table.

## Customizing the standard saved views

You can customize the standard saved views just as you can with your own saved views. However, we strongly recommend that if you do customize one or more standard saved views, then you should save your custom version using a new name. Otherwise, you risk having your customizations overwritten when you update Supply Chain Management.

For more information about how to customize and rename saved views, see see [Saved views](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/saved-views.md?toc=/dynamics365/supply-chain/toc.json).

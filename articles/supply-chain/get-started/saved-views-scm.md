# Standard saved views for Supply Chain Management

Supply chain management includes several saved views that you can enable and use as needed. Some of them are optimized and named for a specific role or task, while others are optimized to include only those fields and settings that Microsoft usage data indicates are most often used by customers (these are typically called "simplified" views). This topic describes each of the available saved views, how to enable them, and how to customize them.

For complete details about how to work with saved views, including the standard saved views once you have enabled them, see 

## Available saved views and how to enable them

The following table lists and describes each of the standard saved views that is currently available. It lists the name of the view, the page where you can find it, a description of the view, and the name of the feature that includes it. Each of the standard saved views must be enabled in [feature management](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md) using the feature name listed in the table.

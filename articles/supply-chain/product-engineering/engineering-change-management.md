# Manage changes to engineering products

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Engineering change management provides a structured processes for managing changes to engineering products. Use the *engineering change request* process to propose and request changes; use the *engineering change order* process to actually make the changes. This lets users create an engineering change request or engineering change order, and then have a process for reviewing and approving them, assessing their impact on existing transactions, and following up on them.

## Engineering change requests

The engineering change request allows you to capture requests for change from all the relevant departments within your company. It doesn't matter whether you work as an engineer, or in the manufacturing, sourcing, warehouse, or sales department&mdash;with the engineering change request, anybody can request a change. This can be an idea for a new product, an issue that you discovered while working with an existing product, a suggestion for improving the product, or something else.

After someone submits a request for change, the *review and approval process* is managed by a workflow that establishes who needs to approve it (for example, the product owner).

To setup the workflow for engineering change orders or engineering change requests go to **Engineering change management \> Engineering workflows**. Select **New** and choose whether you would like to set it up for an engineering change order review or an engineering change request review and then configure the workflow.

For more information about workflows see the [Workflow system overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/overview-workflow-system.md). For more information about product owners, see [Product owner](product-owner.md).

### Create a new engineering change request

To create an engineering change request, do one of the following:

- Go to **Engineering change management \> Common \> Engineering change management \> Engineering change requests** and then select **New** from the Action Pane.
- Open the **Product details** page for an existing engineering product. Then, on the Action Pane, open the **Engineer** tab and, from the **Engineering change management** group, select **Engineering change request \> New engineering change request**.

A new change request is created. Then make the settings on each FastTab, as described in the following subsections.

#### The General FastTab

Use the **General** FastTab to provide a basic description of the change request. Make the settings described in the following table.

| **Setting** | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Change request** | Enter a name for the engineering change request.|
| **Title** | Enter text to briefly describe or identify the changes in the request  |
| **Priority** | Select a value to describe how highly to prioritize this change. You can customize the values available here as required for your company (see also [Establish common values for engineering change management](engineering-change-management-setup.md)). |
| **Category** | Select a value to describe the type of change you are requesting. You can customize the values available here as required for your company (see also [Establish common values for engineering change management](engineering-change-management-setup.md)). |
| **Severity** | Select a value to describe how severe the problem is that should be resolved by implementing this request. You can customize the values available here as required for your company (see also [Establish common values for engineering change management](engineering-change-management-setup.md)). |
| **Requested by** | Shows the name of the user who created the request |
| **On** | Shows the date the request was created. |
| **Status** | Shows the status of the request. When first created, the status is *Created*. When approved, the status changes to *Approved*. If a related change order has been created for this request, the status changes to *Followed up*. |
| **Change order** | If the change request has been followed up with a change order, this field displays the change order number. |

#### The Information FastTab

Use the **Information** FastTab to add more information about your request.

To add a new row here, open the **New** menu from the **Information** toolbar and select one of the following:

- **File** - To upload a file.
- **Image** - To upload an image file.
- **Note** - To enter a note directly into the grid.
- **URL** - To enter a URL directly into the grid.

Each row provides the settings and information described in the following table.

| **Setting** | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Created date and time** | Shows the date and time that the row was created. |
| **Type** | Shows the type that was selected when the row was created (file, image, note, or URL). |
| **Description** | Enter a description for the row. |
| **Restriction** | Indicates whether the information added comes from an internal or external source. |
| **Attached** | If the row includes an attachment (file or image), then a check mark is shown here. To download the attachment, select the row and then select **Open** from the **Information** toolbar. |

#### The Products FastTab

The **Products** FastTab can list each product affected by the change request. Use buttons in the toolbar to add or remove products in the grid.

This list is just for your information, so you can add as many related products as you consider to be relevant. If you create a change request from a product details page, then the product you were looking at should be listed here after you have saved the request record.

#### The Source FastTab

The **Source** FastTab lets you track the starting point of this change request. It is useful, for example, to see whether the change request was created from a sales order, by whom, and in which company.

### Evaluate the business impact of a change request

When you are reviewing a request for change, use the **Dependencies** option to assess the impact of the requested change on open transaction such as sales orders, production orders, and inventory on hand. The **search** option scans all open transactions, which you can view by selecting **view**. If the issue that requires a change is found critical, you can already block the open transactions or notify the responsible user via processing the actions.

<!-- KFM: We should provide just a bit more detail about where we find these buttons. I think they are somewhere on the Action Pane. -->

### Review and approve change requests

### Create a change order from a change request

When an engineer reviews the engineering change request, they can directly create an engineering change order from the change request form by selecting **Copy link and products** in the Action Pane, under the group **Engineering change order**.

<!-- KFM: When we describe items in the Action Pane, we should name the tab, group, and button. For example: "On the Action Pane, open the **Product** tab and, from the **Set up** group, select **Unit conversions**."â€‹  -->

## Engineering change orders

Engineering change orders let you make changes to engineering products using a structured process. You propose changes using a copy of the engineering relevant data without affecting the real master data. For more information on engineering relevant data, see [Engineering versions and engineering product category](engineering-versions-product-category.md). You can create an engineering change order based on an approved engineering change requests, but engineers can also create them from scratch. You can include multiple products in a single engineering change order by doing any of the following:

- Manually select products
- Use the bill of material to include products lower in the product structure (children)
- Use a where-used search to include products higher in the product structure (parents)

<!-- KFM: If possible, we should describe this form and all of its FastTabs and fields, like we do above for engineering change requests. -->

When the proposal for changes is finished, the review and approval process will be handled by a workflow. You can set up different workflows based on the priority and severity.

To setup the workflow for engineering change orders or engineering change requests go to **Engineering change management \> Engineering workflows**. Select **New** and choose whether you would like to set it up for an engineering change order review or an engineering change request review and then configure the workflow.

For more information about workflows, see [Workflow system overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/overview-workflow-system.md).

Typical stakeholders for approving an engineering change order include:

- **Product owners**: For more about product owners, see [Product owner](product-owner.md).
- **Responsible team lead**: the engineering who created the engineering change order is stored in the **Engineer** field, on the **Header** tab of the engineering change order. If this engineer is a part of a team in the system, the team leader of that team will be added in the **Responsible** field on the **Header** tab of the engineering change order.
- **Finance department**: in cases where the change involves high costs.

You can choose whether the engineering change order should be processed directly after approval as part of the workflow, or as a manual step afterwards. Processing an engineering change order will update engineering data on the actual product.

While you are reviewing a request for change, use the **Dependencies** option on the Action Pane to assess the impact of the proposed change on open transactions like sales orders, production orders, and inventory on-hand. With the **Search** option, the system scans all open transactions, which you can then view using the **View** option. You can block the open transactions or notify the responsible user via processing the actions. <!-- KFM: where is these options? BNG these options are inside the business impact form/ dependencies. "Where used", or "Impacted products" maybe? We should have a procedure for how to review a request for change, including steps for how to use each of these options. -->

### Engineering change orders in engineering or operational companies

As described in [Engineering company and data ownership rules](engineering-org-data-ownership-rules.md), the product data that you can edit varies based on which type of legal entity you are working in (engineering or operational company). These rules are also applied to the engineering change order, so based on the legal entity where you create the engineering change order, different types of changes can be made, including:

- **Engineering change orders in an engineering company:** you can make basic changes to the engineering data. This includes creating new versions of a product, changing a product's structure via the bill of materials, and changing engineering attribute values. Select one of the following options from the **Impact** field for each impacted product:
  - **None**: To update the existing product version (in-version update).
  - **New version**: To create a new version based on the selected version.
  - **New product** : To create a completely new product or product variant based on the selected product version.
- **Engineering change orders in an operational company:** you can make changes to the logistical data of the product. For example, you could enrich the existing bill of materials with settings for sourcing; add local routes or local bills of materials; or even enrich a bill of material by adding new bill of material lines for local packaging materials, lubrication fluids, or instructions in the local language. Whenever a user makes these enrichments in the operational company, they will be preserved when new updates are sent over from the engineering company again. See also [Engineering company and data ownership rules](engineering-org-data-ownership-rules.md).

    When the engineering change order is processed in the engineering company, the products are created and/or updated in the engineering company only, so you must also release the products to operational companies to have the product master data updated too.

- You can release directly from the engineering change order manually by selecting **Release product structure** on the Action Pane, under the group **Product releases**. <!-- KFM: On the Action Pane, open the **XXXX** tab and, from the **YYYY** group, select **ZZZZ**."â€‹  --> This is the same option as when doing it from a released products form. For more information see [Release product structure](release-product-structure.md).
- You can release automatically from the engineering change order based on:
  - Re-releasing to companies where the product was previously released. Select **Search** to scan all previous releases, and then view the results by selecting **view**. The **View** page shows the previous product releases and lets you select which ones you would like to release. Close the **View** page and select **Process** to re-release them.
  - Auto-release settings in the release control of the engineering product category. You can do this as part of the workflow. With the block **collect release proposal** , the release proposal will be populated with **re-releasing proposals** (see previous bullet) and products to companies based on the **auto release** check mark in the release control of the engineering product category. The result can be viewed also via the **view** option as described in the previous bullet. With the block **process release proposal** , the products will be released as well. If you choose to only collect the release proposal as part of the workflow, you can manually start the release via the **process** option as described in the previous bullet.

## Follow up an engineering change request with an engineering change order

As soon as an engineering change request is approved, you can follow it up with an engineering change order. You can combine multiple engineering change requests into a single engineering change order, which can even include different products. You'd typically do this when applying the same change needs to multiple products. However, you can't create multiple engineering change orders from a single engineering change request.

To follow up a change request with a change request, select **Copy link and products** on the Action Pane of the engineering change request. <!-- KFM: On the Action Pane, open the **XXXX** tab and, from the **YYYY** group, select **ZZZZ**."â€‹  --> You can then select the engineering change order that you would like to connect it to or to create a new engineering change order to follow the specific request.

## Engineering change order report

Engineering change order reports describe the changes made in an engineering change order. They are useful both during the review and approval process and afterwards, so you can review the changes made by a selected engineering change order.

To view the engineering change order report, select**Engineering change order report** on the Action Pane, under the group **View**. <!-- KFM: On the Action Pane, open the **XXXX** tab and, from the **YYYY** group, select **ZZZZ**."â€‹  -->

## Fields on the engineering change order

Almost all fields on the engineering change order are the same as on the released products, engineering versions, documents, bill of material (lines) and route (operations). However, the fields listed in the following table are unique to the change order:

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Engineering change reasons** | Choose the reason for change for the impacted product. |
| **Change description** | Provide a description of what the change is about |
| **Required special tooling** | Specify whether special tooling is required for applying the change |
| **Engineering material disposition** | Choose a material disposition code for the waste when applying the change |
| **Customer approval required** | Indicate if a customer approval is required before applying the change. |
| **Received customer approval** | Specify the status of the customer approval |
| **Environmental health and safety** | You can first indicate if environmental, health and safety rules are applicable. If so, you can select the rules that are applicable for the change |

Use the **maintain / copy change information** button to copy change information between impacted products.

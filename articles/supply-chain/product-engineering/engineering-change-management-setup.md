# Establish common values for engineering change management

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

When you set up engineering change management, you must establish a few collections of values that you will use to populate drop-down lists in other parts of the interface. You should specify these values according to the types of products you products you produce and your specific business needs.

## Engineering change categories

<!-- KFM Briefly describe what these values are used for and link to any topics where they come up. -->

To establish the collection of engineering change categories in use at your organization, go to **Project Oaktree > Setup > Engineering change management > Engineering change categories**.

Use the buttons on the Action Pane to add, remove, and edit values, and to arrange them into the order in which they should appear in the drop-down lists where these values are shown.

## Engineering change priorities

<!-- KFM Briefly describe what these values are used for and link to any topics where they come up. -->

To establish the collection of engineering change priorities in use at your organization, go to **Project Oaktree > Setup > Engineering change management > Engineering change priorities**.

Use the buttons on the Action Pane to add, remove, and edit values, and to arrange them into the order in which they should appear in the drop-down lists where these values are shown.

## Engineering change reasons

<!-- KFM Briefly describe what these values are used for and link to any topics where they come up. -->

To establish the collection of engineering change reasons in use at your organization, go to **Project Oaktree > Setup > Engineering change management > Engineering change reasons**.

Use the buttons on the Action Pane to add, remove, and edit values, and to arrange them into the order in which they should appear in the drop-down lists where these values are shown.

## Material disposal codes

<!-- KFM Briefly describe what these values are used for and link to any topics where they come up. -->

To establish the collection of material disposal codes in use at your organization, go to **Project Oaktree > Setup > Engineering change management > Material disposal codes**.

Use the buttons on the Action Pane to add, remove, and edit values, and to arrange them into the order in which they should appear in the drop-down lists where these values are shown.

## Received customer approval

<!-- KFM Briefly describe what these values are used for and link to any topics where they come up. -->

To establish the collection of received customer approval values in use at your organization, go to **Project Oaktree > Setup > Engineering change management > Received customer approval**.

Use the buttons on the Action Pane to add, remove, and edit values, and to arrange them into the order in which they should appear in the drop-down lists where these values are shown.

## Engineering change - Environmental health and safety

<!-- KFM Briefly describe what these values are used for and link to any topics where they come up. -->

To establish the collection of health and safety values in use at your organization, go to **Project Oaktree > Setup > Engineering change management > Engineering change - Environmental health and safety**.

Use the buttons on the Action Pane to add, remove, and edit values, and to arrange them into the order in which they should appear in the drop-down lists where these values are shown.

## Engineering change severities

<!-- KFM Briefly describe what these values are used for and link to any topics where they come up. -->

To establish the collection of engineering change severities in use at your organization, go to **Project Oaktree > Setup > Engineering change management > Engineering change severities**.

Use the buttons on the Action Pane to add, remove, and edit values, and to arrange them into the order in which they should appear in the drop-down lists where these values are shown.

You can establish rules that apply to each severity level you create here. See the next section for more information about how to assign these rules.

## Engineering change severity rule sets

<!-- KFM Briefly describe what these settings do and link to any topics where they come up. -->

To set up the rules that apply to each change severity level that you have defined, go to **Project Oaktree > Setup > Engineering change management > Engineering change severity rule sets**. Then do one of the following:

- To create a new rule set, select **New** from the Action Pane and then make settings as described in the following subsections.
- To edit a rule set, select it from the list pane, select **Edit** on the Action Pane, and then make settings as described in the following subsections.
- To delete an existing rule set, select it from the list pane and then select **Delete** on the Action Pane.
- To rearrange the list, select a rule set from the list pane and use **Up** and **Down** buttons on teh Action Pane to reposition it.

For each rule set, make the following settings:

- **Severity** - Select the severity level you want to establish rules for. You can establish these using the **Engineering change severities** page (see the previous section).
- **Rules** - Use the buttons on toolbar on this fast tab to add or remove a rule for the current severity setting. Each rule has a **Rule** and a **Name**. <!-- KFM Where do these rules come from? Should we define each of them here? What is the Name for? -->

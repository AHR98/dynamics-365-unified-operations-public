# Cloud and Edge scale units for manufacturing and warehouse management workloads

Companies within manufacturing and distribution need to be able to execute key business processes 24x7 without interruption and at scale. Companies are challenged on this in situations spanning from plain provider and Azure outage scenarios, unreliable connections, network latency, to business processes competing for the same system resources. The ability to execute daily mission critical processes must be agnostic to such situations. Cloud and Edge will enable companies to execute key mission critical manufacturing and warehouse processes without interruptions.

## Scale units for dedicated workloads

Scale units for supply chain management extend your central Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management cloud hub environment with dedicated processing capacity. Scale units can run in the cloud or on the edge in your local facility premises. Scale units are always connected to the cloud hub environment and receive all information to run the dedicated processing for assigned workloads.

A workload is a defined set of business functionality that can be factored out and delegated to a scale unit. As of today two types of workloads are supported:

- Manufacturing execution
- Warehouse management

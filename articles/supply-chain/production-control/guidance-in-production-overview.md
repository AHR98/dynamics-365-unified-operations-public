# Guidance for workers in production

Workers in production processes will greatly profit from relevant guidance which must be provided in the context of their work and at the right time.
There are several domains of work where guidance is applicable: Assembly, service, operations, certification, and safety.

Across all of these core business functions, new employees, new equipment, new process and ongoing training guidance will empower workers to achieve more and work better.

## Introduction to Guidance

You can provide guidance in different ways. One very efficient system that ships out of the box uses [Dynamics 365 Guides](https://dynamics.microsoft.com/en-us/mixed-reality/guides/).

With Guides you empower your employees with hands-on learning.you can define standardize processes with step-by-step instructions that guide your employees to the tools and parts they need and how to use them in real work situations. Below are listed a few domains where customer across industries see the biggest value for guidance.  

### Assembly

[![Assembly](./media/work-guides-hero-assembly.png)](./media/work-guides-hero-assembly.png)

Guidance in assembly operations shows workers the tools and parts they need and how to use them in real work situations.

As a production manager you will create and assign guidance for example for [production routes](routes-operations.md), [operation relations](routes-operations.md#operation-relations), or [bill of materials](bill-of-material-bom.md). Workers will find the relevant guidance on the respective operation experience on the shop floor. 

### Service

You can equip technicians with guided instructions at the job site, eliminating the need to schedule additional visits.

As a service manager you can assign guides for example to [products](../../commerce/product.md) that walk through routines of quality assessment.

### Quality

Rollout new processes and ensure increased consistency by turning employee knowledge into a repeatable tool.

As a quality assurance manager you can assign guides for example to [products](../../commerce/product.md) that walk through routines of quality assessment.

### Certifications

[![Assembly](./media/work-guides-hero-certification.png)](./media/work-guides-hero-certification.png)

Ensure every employee meets high standards by quickly identifying who needs help where.

### Safety

[![Assembly](./media/work-guides-hero-safety.png)](./media/work-guides-hero-safety.png)

Provide guidance that walks through dangerous procedures virtually before attempting in the physical environment. With a mixed reality approach workers can experience dangerous procedures virtually.

As a production manager you can provide dedicated guidance for hazardous material handling or delicate handling procedures by assigning guidance to [product items](../../commerce/product.md), [routes](routes-operations.md) and [operations](routes-operations.md#operation-relations) while tagging your guidance with a dedicated safety instruction [category](guidance-howto-use-categories.md) which you can create yourself as needed.

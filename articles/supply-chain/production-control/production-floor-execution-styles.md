title: User interface control styles for production floor execution
description: The production floor execution interface is set up for every device on the production floor. Companies typically set up each device differently, depending on the purpose that the device serves. For example, a company might have one device in the reception area, where workers clock in and clock out, and another on the shop floor, where workers manage their jobs.

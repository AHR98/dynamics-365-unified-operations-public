Document handling notes do not transfer from Original Sales Order to Direct Delivery Purchase Order 
 


## Resolution
Microsoft has investigated the reported issue. Notes are only copied accross purchase and sales orders for intercompany. Notes are not copied in the context of direct delivery, which is what is requested. Works as intended.  
  
If you would like Microsoft to consider this request in future product planning, then please enter a request on the Ideas Portal site.

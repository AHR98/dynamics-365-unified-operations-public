KB Number: 4611503

## Issue description

Process Manufacturing Formula line Step Conversion setup does not always work in a Batch Order if the finished good Quantity is changed.

## Resolution

This is similar to KB 4562507

In the above mentioned KB context it was non-standard formula  (Height \* Width \* Depth/Density) \* Constantâ€‹ but its relevant for step consumption scenario as well.
Material's BOMQty (quantity per unit) is not altered after its computed when production order is created/phantom level exploded.

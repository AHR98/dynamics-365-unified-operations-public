# Unable to show new notes attached to a journal in the picking list report

KB Number: 4611660

## Symptoms

You are unable to show the new notes attached to a picking list journal in the picking list report.

## Resolution

The pickling list report only prints notes attached on the sales older line and header.  The new note added in the invoice journal won't be shown in the report.

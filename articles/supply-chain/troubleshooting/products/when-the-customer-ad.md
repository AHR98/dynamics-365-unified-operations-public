# Purchase orders don't show translated product text

KB Number: 4612098

## Symptoms

You are able to define text translations for product names. However, the product name is always be shown in the original language, regardless of the language setting in the app.

## Resolution

This is the expected behavior. Product translations are only shown on external facing documents, not to internal users. For more information ,see [Product-related translations FAQ](../../pim/translations-product-related-information.md#where-can-i-view-the-translated-information)

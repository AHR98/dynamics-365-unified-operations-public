# Sales Order Line entry function, the filter functionality will not save to "contains" and always defaults to "begins with". 

KB Number: 4611879

Sales Order Line entry function, the filter functionality will not save to "contains" and always defaults to "begins with".
 


## Resolution
This issue is not reproduceable on the latest application version (10.0.19). On a sales order, when a new sales order line is added and the filtering criteria on the item number is changed to 'contains', then for all the other sales lines, the filtering criteria will be set to 'contains'.

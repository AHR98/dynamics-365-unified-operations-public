# When receipting product in, if multiple work created for one part, only one label prints

KB Number: 4614667

## Issue description

When receipting product in, if multiple work created for one part, only one label prints

## Resolution

Microsoft has evaluated this issue and determined not to fix this issue as a hot-fix.
In the current design it is a single license plate label which gets generated based on a single work information and not 'work labels' getting created based on target license plates.

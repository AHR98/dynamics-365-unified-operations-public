## Overview

The Global Inventory Accounting Add-in for Microsoft Dynamics 365 Supply Chain Management provides a comprehensive solution that enables organizations (especially international organizations) to perform inventory accounting using multiple costing ledgers. This enables organizations to comply with multiple accounting standards and internal management accounting at the same time.

International organizations are under increasing pressure from authorities to comply with local and global accounting standards, and the valuation of inventory plays a significant role in securing compliance. Global Inventory Accounting lets you account inventory in multiple representations by applying the appropriate valuation method (standard cost, average, or specific identification) and the selected accounting currency per instance. Global Inventory Accounting enables organizations to report inventory statements and subledger accounting values (also known as the inventory balance and the cost of goods sold) in what is often referred to as dual valuation and/or dual currency.

Inventory accounting is performed in individual ledgers. Several cost accounting ledgers can be created for each legal entity in an organization as needed, thereby ensuring that multiple inventory representations can be obtained. All documents (such as purchase orders, sales orders, transfer orders, and so on) posted in a legal entity will be accounted in all the costing ledgers associated with that legal entity.

A cost accounting ledger is defined by a combination of the following elements:

- Calendar
- Currency
- Exchange rate table
- Convention

A convention is a collection of inventory accounting policies that can be associated to one or more ledgers. They enable you to share a common convention within your organization.

## Availability

Global Inventory Accounting is currently available in the following Azure geographies:

If you try to install the add-in from another geographic region, Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) will show a message that your geography is not supported. Global Inventory Accounting does not support on-premises deployments of Supply Chain Management.

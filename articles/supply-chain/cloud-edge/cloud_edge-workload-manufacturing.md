# Manufacturing execution workload for cloud and edge scale units - public preview

> [!WARNING]
> Please note that certain business functionality is not fully supported in the public preview when using workloads scale units.  

## Dedicated manufacturing execution workload capabilities in a scale unit

Within manufacturing execution, cloud and edge scale units deliver the following capabilities, even when edge units aren't connected to the cloud:

- Enable machine operators and shop floor supervisors to access the operational production plan.
- Enable machine operators to keep the plan current by executing discrete and process manufacturing jobs.
- Enable the shop floor supervisor to adjust the operational plan.
- Enable workers to access time and attendance for clock-in and clock-out on the edge to ensure correct worker pay calculation.

# About printing packing slips

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

If you work with direct delivery, a packing slip can be printed automatically for the intercompany purchase order and the original sales order when you post the packing slip on the intercompany sales order.

To print packing slips automatically, in the  **Intercompany**  page for purchase orders, select both of the  **Print packing slip automatically**  fields.

If you update the packing slip on the intercompany sales order, the changes are reflected automatically on the intercompany purchase order and the original sales order.

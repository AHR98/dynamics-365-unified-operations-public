# Customer electronic invoices in Norway

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

To comply with European Union's Directive 2014/55/EU, the Norway-specific format of electronic invoices, **EHF Billing 3.0** have been implemented based on the [PEPPOL Billing 3.0](https://docs.peppol.eu/poacc/billing/3.0/) specification.

This topic provides information about how to configure and issue customer electronic invoices in Norway.

## Prerequisites

The primary address of the legal entity must be in Norway.

## Import Electronic reporting configurations
In the **Electronic reporting** workspace, import the following Electronic reporting (ER) formats from the repository:

- OIOUBL Sales invoice
- OIOUBL Project invoice
- OIOUBL Sales credit note
- OIOUBL Project credit note

> [!NOTE]
> These formats are based on the **Invoice model** configuration, and use the **Invoice model mapping** configuration. All required additional configurations are automatically imported.

For more information about how to import ER configurations, see [Download Electronic reporting configurations from Lifecycle Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/analytics/download-electronic-reporting-configuration-lcs).

### Reference imported ER format configurations

1. Go to **Accounts receivable** \> **Setup** \> **Accounts receivable parameters**.
2. On the **Electronic documents** tab, select the imported format options for electronic documents.

### Sales tax codes transformation
When you generate electronic invoices, the sales tax code rates are analyzed and transformed to [UNCL5305-compliant categories](https://docs.peppol.eu/pracc/catalogue/1.0/codelist/UNCL5305/) according to the following logic:

 - For all non-zero tax rates, the **S** category is used
 - For all zero tax rates, either the **E** or **Z** category is used depending on the configured reporting code for tax-free sales.

# RCS Discontinuing configuration in RCS/Global repository

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## Overview:
This topic describes how to discontinue configuration in the RCS Global repository. Previously is was possible only to delete configuration that were no longer required, now we have added a new feature that supports the capability of marking a released configuration as ‘Discontinued’ in the Global repo in RCS and it can be used to:
 - provide upfront notification of when a configuration is planned to be discontinued,
 - include details about the replacement configuration (if applicable), and
 - set a 'supported until' date for the specific configuration to inform the user as to when it is planned to be discontinued.

##Feature capabilities:
- You can discontinue a configuration version and specify the following discontinuation information; all fields are optional:
  - Replacement configuration
  - Replacement configuration version
  - Free text note - this field should be used to convey additional documentation links or references
  - 'Supported until' - provides the proposed date up to which the current configuration/version will be supported to. Note that this date is not updated automatically, so if used, will need to be maintained manually.
  
- To discontinue the configuration, you need to:
  - Select whether you want to discontinue a single version or if you want to discontinue all versions with the same settings in one operation slide 'All versions' parameter to 'Yes' 
  - Slide Discontinue' parameter to 'Yes'.
  - Click 'Ok' to discontinue the configuration(s). Note Discontinued date will be populated on save, when the discontinue parameter is 'Yes'.
  
- You can revert configuration back to Shared or adjust discontinuation info at anytime.
- You can keep configuration Shared, but specify 'Supported until' (and all other discontinuation info) to indicate your plans to discontinue the configuration in future.

**Note:** Discontinuation does not limit any operations with configurations for customers, they still can import, run or derive them, it's just informational fields.

##Discontinuation details form:

##F&O supports displaying this information starting from 10.0.14

- On the Global repository form:
  - User will see the up to date information related to discontinuation.
  - By default, configurations that are discontinued will be filtered out.
  
- On imported Configurations form (ERSolutionTable)
  - For the configurations that were already discontinued when there were imported.
  - For configurations that were discontinued after they were imported - discontinuation info can be synchronized by running "Import configurations updates" job.

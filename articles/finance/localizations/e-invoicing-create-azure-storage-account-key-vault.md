# Create an Azure storage account and a key vault

The e-Invoicing service assumes the storage of all your business data in the
Microsoft Azure resources that are owned by your company. For correct service
functional behavior and to ensure that all the business data that is needed for
the e-Invoicing service and generated by the e-Invoicing service is accessed
only by the service, you must create two main Azure resources:

-   An Azure storage account (Blob storage) to store electronic invoices

-   An Azure key vault to store certificates and the Uniform Resource Identifier
    (URI) of the storage account

Note: A dedicated key vault resource and customer Blob storage must be allocated
specifically for use with the e-Invoicing service.

# Prerequisites

Before you can complete the steps in this topic, you must make sure that the
following tasks have been completed:

-   Create a key vault resource in Azure. For more information, see [About Azure
    Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/general/overview).

-   Create an Azure storage account (Blob storage). For more information, see
    Maintaining Azure Storage Account.

# Overview

In this topic, you will complete two main steps:

-   Set up the Azure storage account to get the storage account URI.

-   Set up the key vault to store the storage account URI.

# Set up the Azure storage account to get the storage account URI

1.  Open the storage account that you plan to use with the e-Invoicing service.

2.  Go to **Blob service** \> **Containers**, and create a new container.

3.  Enter a name for the container, and set the **Public access level** field to
    **Private (no anonymous access)**.

4.  Open the container that you just created, and go to **Settings \> Access
    policy**.

5.  Select **Add policy** to add a stored access policy.

6.  Set the **Identifier** and **Permissions** fields as appropriate. In the
    **Permissions** field, you should select all permissions.

7.  Enter the start and expiry dates. The expiry date should be in future.

8.  Select **OK** to save the policy, and then save your changes to the
    container.

9.  Return to the storage account, and open **Storage Explorer (preview)**.

10. Right-click Container, and then select **Get Shared Access Signature**.

11. In the **Shared Access Signature** dialog box, copy and store the value in
    the **URI** field. This value will be used in the next procedure and will be
    referred to as the *shared access signature URI*.

# Set up the key vault to store the storage account URI

1.  Open the key vault you intend to use with the e-Invoicing service.

2.  Go to **Settings** \> **Secrets**, and then select **Generate/Import** to
    create a new secret.

3.  On the **Create a secret** page, in the **Upload options** field, select
    **Manual**.

4.  Enter the name of the secret. This name will be used during setup of the
    service in RCS and will be referred to as the *key vault secret name*.

5.  In the **Value** field, select **Shared Access Signature URI**, and then
    select **Create**.

6.  You must set up the access policy to grant the correct level of e-Invoicing
    service secure access to the secret that you created. Go to **Settings \>
    Access policy**, and select **Add Access Policy**.

7.  Set the secret permissions for the **Get** and **List** operations.

8.  Set the certificate permissions for **Get** and **List** operations:

    ![Machine generated alternative text: Add access policy Add access policy Configure from template (optional) Key permissions Secret permissions Certificate permissions Select principal Authorized application \@ O selected 2 selected 2 selected \@ Select all Certificate Management Operations Update Import Delete Backup Manage Cont•cts Manage Certificate Authorities Get Certificate Authorities List Certificate Authorities Set Certificate Authorities Delete Certificate Authorities Privileged Certificate Operations Purge ](media/41b7c7b3fdb90908757d9ff6c5c3d812.png)

9.  In the **Principal** dialog box, select the principal by adding
    **e-Invoicing Service**.

10. Select **Add**, and then select **Save Key Vault changes**.

11. On the **Overview** page, copy the **DNS name** value for the key vault.
    This value will be used during setup of the service in RCS and will be
    referred as the *key vault URI*.

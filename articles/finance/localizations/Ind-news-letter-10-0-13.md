 ### TCS on Sales of Goods : 
 
 This feature will  cover the following two key aspects of this feature  :  
 (1) PAN-based accumulation of transaction if multiple customers/vendor have the same PAN number  
 (2) Tax liability of TCS can accrue at the time of receipt of payment 
 As per newly introduced section 206C (1H) TCS should be collected at the time of receipt of payment from a customer given this interim accounting option of
 posting is  introduced for this feature. Where TCS amount will be posted to the interim account and added to invoice value at the time of issuance of the invoice, 
 the liability of TCS will be recorded in the books at the time of receipt of payment. Another important aspect of this feature is that if multiple customers
 have the same PAN  number than accumulate transaction value will be taken to compare with the threshold limit to determine the eligible amount of transaction 
 for TCS deduction.

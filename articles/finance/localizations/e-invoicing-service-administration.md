# Electronic invoicing add-on administration components

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides information about the components related to the administration of the Electronic invoicing add-on and how to configure the service.

## Azure

Use Azure to create the secrets for the KeyVault and Storage account, and use them in the configuration of Electronic invoicing add-on.

## Life Cycle Services (LCS)

Use Life Cycle Services (LCS) to enable the add-on for the microservices for your LCS deployment project.

The following feature must be enabled under the tile **Preview feature management** in LCS:

   - **e-Invoicing Service**

## Microsoft Dynamics 365 Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS)

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS) is the interface for configuration of the Electronic invoicing add-on. The resources, such as Environments and Electronic invoicing features are created, maintained, and hosted in the RCS, and when ready, the resources are published to the Electronic invoicing add-on service.

For more information about RCS, seeÂ [Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS) - Globalization features](rcs-globalization-feature.md)

### Integration with Electronic invoicing add-on

Before you start to use RCS to configure electronic invoices, configure RCS to allow communication with Electronic invoicing add-on on the **Electronic reporting parameters** page, on **Electronic invoicing add-on** tab.

#### Service endpoint

The service endpoint is the URL of the Electronic invoicing add-on:

<https://electronicinvoicinglocal.wus2-il100.gateway.test.island.powerapps.com/>

#### Application ID

The application ID is the ID of the Electronic invoicing add-on application. In this case, the value is fixed:

   - 0cdb527f-a8d1-4bf8-9436-b352c68682b2

#### LCS environment ID

The LCS environment ID is the ID of your LCS subscription from your organization.

### Service environments

The Service environments are logical partitions created to support the execution of the electronic invoicing features within the Electronic invoicing add-on. 

The security secrets and digital certificates, and the governance (access permissions) must be configured at the Service environment level. 

Customers can create as many service environments as they want, and the environments are independent of each other.

The service environments must be created and maintained in RCS, and when ready, they must be published to the Electronic invoicing add-on.

#### Service environment status

The Service environments can have up to three statuses:

   - **Not published**: When the environment is created, but not published.
   - **Published**: When the environment is published to the electronic invoicing service.
   - **Changed**: When the attributes of a published environment are changed, but the changes aren't published yet.

#### Customer secrets

The Electronic invoicing add-on service takes responsibility for storing all your business data in the Microsoft Azure resources that are owned by your company. To ensure that the service works correctly, and that all the business data that is needed for and generated by the Electronic invoicing add-on is accessed only by the add-on, you must create two main Azure resources:

- An Azure storage account (Blob storage) to store electronic invoices
- An Azure key vault to store certificates and the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) of the storage account

> [!NOTE]
> A dedicated key vault resource and customer Blob storage must be allocated specifically for use with the Electronic invoicing add-on.

For more information, see [Create AzureStorage Account and KeyVault](e-invoicing-create-azure-storage-account-key-vault.md).

#### Users

Each service environment must list the users who can connect from Finance and Supply Chain Management in the Electronic invoicing add-on.

#### Publish

The Service environments must be published to the electronic invoicing service to be used. Only after publishing, the environment can be accessed by Finance and Supply Chain Management. Even after an update to any of the environment's attributes, the Service environment must be published for the changes take effect on the electronic invoicing service.

### Connected applications

The Connected applications are the instances of Finance and Supply Chain Management you may want to reach through RCS. Besides the application URL and it's tenant, the Conection application also contains the credentials to allow RCS to connect to this environment.

Through the Connected applications, you can configure the part of the electronic invoicing feature in Finance and Supply Chain Management to make the entire electronic invoicing feature work.

## Finance and Supply Chain Management

### Integration with Electronic invoicing add-on

Before you use Finance and Supply Chain Management to issue electronic invoices through the Electronic invoicing add-on, the add-on must be configured to allow communication with the service.

#### Electronic Invoicing add-on integration feature

To enable communication between Finance and Supply Chain Management and the Electronic invoicing add-on, the feature **Electronic Invoicing add-on integration** must be enabled through Feature management workspace.

#### Service endpoint

The service endpoint is the URL where the Electronic invoicing add-on is located. The service endpoint must be configured in Finance and Supply Chain Management to allow communication with the service to issue electronic invoices.

Go to **Organization administration** > **Setup** > **Electronic document parameter** and on the **Submission services** tab, in the **Electronic invoicing add-on URL** field, enter:

    `<https://electronicinvoicinglocal.wus2-il100.gateway.test.island.powerapps.com/>`

#### Environments

The Environment name entered in Finance and Supply Chain Management refers to the name of the environment created in RCS and published to the Electronic invoicing add-on.

The environment must be configured on the **Electronic document parameter** page, on the **Submission services** tab, so that every request to issue electronic invoices contains the environment where the Electronic invoicing add-on can determine which electronic invoicing feature must process the request.

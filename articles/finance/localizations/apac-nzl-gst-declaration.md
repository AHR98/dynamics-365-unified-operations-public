## Overview

This topic explains how to set up and generate the GST return form GST101A for legal entities in New Zealand.

The GST return form for New Zealand is the standard document that summarizes the total output GST tax amount due, the total input GST tax amount recoverable, and the related GST tax amount  liability. The form is used for all types of taxpayers and should be completed manually through the tax authority portal. The GST return form is commonly referred to as *Filing GST returns*.

The GST return form in Dynamics 365 Finance includes the following reports:

- GST return form GST101A, where the information is consolidated in two groups of boxes (1 to 4), GST on sales and GST on expenses as is described in the legislation. Legal entity details are printed in the top of the form. It includes the GST number, the period covered by the return, due date, mailing address and daytime phone number.
 - Sales transactions details.
 - Purchase transaction details.

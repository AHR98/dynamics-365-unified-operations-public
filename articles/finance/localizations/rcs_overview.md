# Microsoft Dynamics 365 Regulatory Configuration Service

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Regulatory Configuration Services (“RCS”) is a standalone designer and lifecycle management service for no code / low code globalization functionality. That allows globalization stakeholder to extend and customize key globalization areas of tax, e-invoicing, regulatory reporting, banking, and business documents without involving developers. This no code / low code globalization approach makes globalization easier, faster, and more cost effective to create or extend.
RCS provides the following capabilities:
- It supports all functionality, provided by Electronic Reporting.
- It is a prerequisite to configure new globalization microservices:
  -	Electronic Invoicing - For more information, see [Electronic Invoicing Add-on for Dynamics 365 (general availability) - Dynamics 365 Release Plan | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance/electronic-invoicing-add-on-dynamics-365-ga.md)
  -	Tax Calculation (Preview) - For more information, see [Tax service (preview) - Dynamics 365 Release Plan | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance/tax-service-preview.md)
-	It supports new Globalization feature functionality that simplifies lifecycle management of multi-component features, and provides extra capability to configuring actions and set up feature parameters - For more information, see - [Regulatory Configuration Service – simplified globalization feature management for globalization services - Dynamics 365 Release Plan | Microsoft Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance/regulatory-configuration-service-simplified-globalization-feature-management-globalization-services.md)
-	It supports centrally publishing, storing, and sharing custom configuration in Global Repository to simplify configuration management without using Dynamics Lifecycle Services.

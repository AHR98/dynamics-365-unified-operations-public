# Get started with the e-Invoicing service for Mexico

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]
[!include [banner](../includes/preview-banner.md)]


The e-Invoicing service for Mexico may not currently support all the functions that are available in the CFDI document and related integration that is built
into Dynamics 365 Finance or Dynamics 365 Supply chain management.

In this topic, you will learn how to enable e-invoicing services for Mexico, including the configuration steps which are Mexico-dependent in Regulatory Configuration Services (RCS) and in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. This topic also guides you through the process in Finance for submitting CFDI invoices through the service, and how to acknowledge the results of processing over the status in CFDI invoices.

## Prerequisites

To complete these steps, you must first do or verify the following:

- Complete the steps described in Get started with e-invoicing service.

## RCS setup

During the RCS setup you will:

- Import the e-invoicing feature for processing CFDI invoices.
- Review the format configurations required for CFDI invoices generation, submission and response scenarios, and cancellation submission and response.
- Configure the events that will support the CFDI invoice submission scenarios.
- Publish the CFDI invoice e-invoicing feature.

The **e-Invoicing feature** is the generic name of the resource that will be configured and published for consumption of the e-Invoicing service server. In this case, the CFDI invoices (MX) is the e-Invoicing feature we want to set up.

Import e-Invoicing features

1. Sign into your RCS account and go to the **Globalization features workspace**.
2. Select **Features \> e-invoicing**.
3. Select **Import** to import the **CFDI invoices (MX)** feature from the Global repository.

> [!NOTE]
> If you donâ€™t see the feature in the list, select **Synchronize** and then repeat step 3.

![Select import CDFI feature](media/e-Invoicing-services-get-started-MEX-Select-Import-CFDI-feature.png)

If you import the **CFDI invoices (MX)** feature from Global repository, all feature settings, including configurations and actions are imported too.

### Create a new version of the CFDI invoices (MX) feature

You can create a new version, for example, if updating URLs is needed. For more information, see .

1. On the **e-Invoicing Features** page, select the **Versions** tab.
2. Select **New**.

![Select New e-Invoicing feature](media/e-Invoicing-services-get-started-MEX-Select-New-e-Invoicing-feature.png)

### Configuration versions

1. On the **e-Invoicing Features** page, on the **Configurations** tab, select **Add** or **Delete** to manage the configuration versions.

![Manage e-Invoicing feature Configurations](media/e-Invoicing-services-get-started-MEX-Manage-e-Invoicing-feature-Configurations.png)

When you create a new version, all configurations are inherited from the last published version. To process CFDI invoices, the following configurations are required:

   - CFDI invoice (BusinessDocumentService)
   - CFDI response message import
   - CFDI error log import
   - CFDI cancelation request (MX) (BusinessDocumentService)
   - CFDI invoice (BusinessDocumentService)

2. From the list, select a configuration version, and then select **Edit** or **View** to access the **ER format designer** to edit or view a configuration.

![Configuration ER format designer](media/e-Invoicing-services-get-started-MEX-Configuration-ER-format-designer.png)

Use the **Format designer** to edit and view the ER format file configurations. For more information, see [Create electronic document configurations](../../dev-itpro/analytics/electronic-reporting-configuration.md).

## Processing electronic invoices in Finance 

During the processing of CFDI invoices in Finance through e-Invoicing service, you can:

- Submit CFDI invoices
- View the submission execution logs
- Submit the cancellation of a CFDI invoice

## Submit CFDI invoices

After you enable the **Configurable e-Invoicing Service integration** feature, the **Export/Import electronic invoice process** (**Accounts receivable** \>
**Invoices** \> **E-invoices**) for submitting CFDI invoices can no longer be used and it is replaced by the new process, **Submit electronic documents**.

> [!NOTE]
> Before you use the new **Submit electronic documents** process, verify that the setup required for Mexican e-invoices was completed. For more information, see [CFDI layout version 3.3](latam-mex-cfdi-3-3.md).

1. Go to **Organization administration \> Periodic \> Electronic documents \> Submit electronic documents**.
2. For the first submission of the document, always set the **Resubmit documents** field to **No**. Set the **Resubmit documents** field to **Yes** if you need to resubmit a document through the service
3. Expand the **Records to include** FastTab, and select **Filter** to build the query and select documents for submission.

![Submit CFDI document](media/e-Invoicing-services-get-started-MEX-Submit-CFDI-document.png)

When you first attempt to submit a document through the services, you will be asked to confirm the connection with the e-Invoicing service. Select **Click here to connect to Electronic Document Submission Service**.

## View submission logs

You can view submission log for all submitted documents or for just one.

### View all submission logs

After you enable the **Configurable e-Invoicing Service integration** feature, a new page is available that you can use to follow up on the document submission process. Through this page you can see the submission logs for all submitted documents.

1. Go to **Organization administration \> Periodic \> Electronic documents \> Electronic document submission log**.

- **Action files**: The intermediate files generated with the execution of the actions. Select **View** to download and view the file .
- **Processing action log**: The results of the communication between the e-Invoicing service with the target web service, and what was returned of the processing from the web service. The **Error code** column contains the return code that was returned by the authorization web service.
- When the submitted CFDI invoice is authorized, the status of CFDI invoice is updated to **Approved**.

For CFDI invoices which were submitted after enabling the **Configurable e-Invoicing Service integration** feature, the **History** button is not enabled.

## Submit cancellation of CFDI invoices

After you enable the **Configurable e-Invoicing Service integration** feature, the legacy process for cancelling CFDI invoices no longer works as it is replaced by a new cancellation process that is embedded on **Electronic document submission log.**

1. Go to **Accounts receivable \> Inquires and reports \> CFDI (electronic invoices)**.
2. If the CFDI invoice has the status **Approved**, select **Function \> Cancel CFDI**.

# Bank symbols for bank accounts 
Constant symbols are set up for bank accounts and then used on sales orders, purchase orders, customer invoices, and free text invoices. 
Use the **Bank constant symbols** page to set up a list of constant symbols. By default, when you set up a constant symbol for a specific company bank account, the symbol is copied to sales orders and free text. From the sales order or free text invoice, the constant symbol is transferred to the customer invoice. 
> [!NOTE]
> By default, when you set up a specific symbol for a bank account, it is copied to the vendor invoice printout form. The constant symbol is also displayed on invoice printouts. 

You can set up bank symbols on the **Bank constant symbols** page (**Cash and bank management** > **Setup** > **Constant symbols**).

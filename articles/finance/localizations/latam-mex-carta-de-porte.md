## Posting packing slips and shipping transfer orders with the Waybill (Carta de Porte) complement

## Setup

### Catalogs

Set up the following catalogs to add information to the **Permission type**, **Trailer type** and **Federal motor transport configuration** fields.

1. Go to **Organization administration** > **Setup** > **EInvoice** > **SAT classification** > **Transportation**.
2. On the **Transportation** page, create the following:

  - Trailer type (SAT catalog is c_SubTipoRem)
  - Permission type (SAT catalog is c_TipoPermiso)

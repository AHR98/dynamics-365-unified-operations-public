This topic walks you through the process of setting up VAT declaration with registers (also called JPK_V7M, VDEK) in Poland. 

## Overview

For periods starting from October 1, 2020, businesses in Poland are responsible for reporting Value-added tax (VAT) in an electronic document that consist of Jednolity Plik Kontrolny VAT (JPK_VAT) with the declaration (Jednolity Plik Kontrolny VDEK).

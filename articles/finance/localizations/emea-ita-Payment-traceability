# Bills of exchange protest import 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

For Italian companies who are working with public sector companies, it might be required to control the Tender procedure identification and CIPE codes during end-to-end processing from the original invoice to the payment both in Accounts Receivable and Accounts Payable modules.

## Prerequisites

Before you can use the Bill of exchange protest import functionality, the following prerequisites must be met:

- The primary address of the legal entity must be in Italy.
- The feature (Italy) Base document tracking improvements must be turned on in the **Feature management** workspace. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-and-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## Feature details

With the feature activated, the Tender procedure identification (CIG) and CIPE (CUP) codes are inherited in relation to the particular customer or vendor transaction for higher traceability across the system and could be reviewed using the standard personalization mechanism. For inheriting the values from the original invoice transaction during Payment proposal, on the Methods of payment form the Base document payment attribute should be activated. 
To ensure that the mandatory fields corresponding for the CIG and CUP codes are populated in the transaction, it is possible to mark Customer or Vendor account or group as with Public sector parameter.

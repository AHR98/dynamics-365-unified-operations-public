#  Regulatory Configuration Service

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Regulatory Configuration Service (RCS) is a standalone designer and lifecycle management service for no code/low code globalization functionality. RCS allows globalization stakeholders to extend and customize key globalization areas of tax, e-invoicing, regulatory reporting, banking, and business documents without involving developers. This no code/low code globalization approach makes globalization easier, faster, and more cost effective to create or extend.

RCS provides the following capabilities:

   - Supports all functionality provided by Electronic Reporting.
   - Prerequisite to configure new globalization microservices.
   - Supports Electronic Invoicing. For more information, see [Electronic Invoicing](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance/electronic-invoicing-add-on-dynamics-365-ga.md).
   - Supports Tax Calculation. For more information, see [Tax service](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance/tax-service-preview.md).
   - Supports new Globalization feature functionality that simplifies the lifecycle management of multi-component features and provides extra capability to configure actions and set up feature parameters. For more information, see [Regulatory Configuration Service â€“ simplified globalization feature management for globalization services](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365-release-plan/2021wave1/finance-operations/dynamics365-finance/regulatory-configuration-service-simplified-globalization-feature-management-globalization-services.md)
-	Supports the central publishing, storing, and sharing of custom configurations in the Global repository to simplify configuration management without using LCS.

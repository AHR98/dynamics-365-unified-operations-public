# Post transition adjustment journal entries

This topic describes functionality that lets you transition a lease portfolio to the new accounting standards â€“ US GAAP ASC 842 and IFRS 16.

For a full review of the transition methods, see [Transition methods](transition-methods.md). For information on how to setup a book to transition to the new standards, please review the [Set up lease books]().

When the user creates the transition adjustment journal entry, a journal entry will be generated to reflect the balance sheet impact of recording that lease under the new standards at that date. The appropriate asset account will be debited for the carrying amount at that date and the liability account will be credited. The difference will be either debited or credited to retained earnings.

1. To post a transition adjustment in compliance with the new accounting standards, select the lease from the Lease summary form and click **Books**.
2. In the book, select **Payment schedule**.
3. Click **Confirm** and exit the payment schedule
4. Click **Transition adjustment**.

 	> [!Note]
 	> Only those lease books assigned to a book with the Transition book field enabled will allow for a transition adjustment entry to be created. Also, if the **Lease commencement** field is later than the transition date then the transition adjustment will not populate.
  
5.	To view the journal entry, select **General journals**.
6.	Select the new journal and click **Post**.

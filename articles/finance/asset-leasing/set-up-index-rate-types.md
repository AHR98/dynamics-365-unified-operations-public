# Set up index rates

If lease payments are dependent on an index, those index rate types can be added and maintained in the system. The index rate revaluation process will use the most recent index rate from the date of revaluation to revalue the lease payments from the **Index rate type** page.

1. To add index rate types and index rates, navigate to **Asset leasing > Setup > Index rate type**.
2. Click **New**. Enter the rate type, and the name of the index rate, in the respective fields.
3. To add a new index rate value, select the index rate type and click **Add**. Select the effective start date of the rate, and the rate value.

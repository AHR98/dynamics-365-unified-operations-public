There are three user roles designed to give users rights inside the asset leasing module. The Asset leasing module contains three user roles relating to leasing â€“ Maintain lease, View lease, and Lease clerk. Each role contains specific permissions for all lease forms and functions allowing users to view, create, edit, or delete leases according to their job duties.

|     Role              	|     Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	|
|-----------------------	|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------	|
|     Maintain Lease    	|     User has access to add, edit, delete, and view leases.   This role is designed for daily users who are tasked with creating and   posting monthly journal entries and adding new leases. This role allows   access to all functionality of the leasing application.                                                                          	|
|     View Lease        	|     User only has access to view lease records, schedules, and   run reports. The user cannot create a new lease or edit an existing lease.   This role does not allow users to create journal entries against leases. The   role is designed for a user to solely view leases, their schedules, and the   transactions against those leases.    	|
|     Lease Clerk       	|     User only has access to create a new lease. The user does   not have access to modify or delete any existing leases. This role is   designed for a data entry role and does not have permission to view the   leasing schedules or post leasing journal entries.                                                                             	|

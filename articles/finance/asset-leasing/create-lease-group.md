# Create a lease group

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Lease groups are a mandatory field when creating a lease as it determines the default books to create for a lease. Lease books are associated to a lease group. Accounts can be specified in the Lease posting accounts setup for a specific book.

1. To create a lease book, go to **Asset leasing > Setup > Lease groups**.
2. To add a lease group, click on the **New** button in the action pane. A new line will add to the lease group grid.
3. In the **Name** field, enter a value
4. In the **Description** field, enter a value

The information added in the preceding steps will be added to the **Lease group** drop-down list on the **Add lease** page.

## Associate a book to a lease group

After creating the lease groups, books can be assigned to each group. When a user creates a lease and assigns it to a lease group, the system will create a set of schedules for each book associated to that lease group.

1. To add books to a group, go to **Asset leasing > Setup > Lease group**.
2. Highlight a lease group then select **Books** button
3. Click **New**, and then select the book you wish to assign to the lease group from the Book type drop-down menu. You can assign multiple books to a lease group if a user needs to account for a lease in different ways. 

> [!Note] 
> Books must be set up first before they can be assigned to a lease group.

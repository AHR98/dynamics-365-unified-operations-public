|     Lease ID                      	|     This is a unique key automatically generated by the system   for each new lease entry.                                                                                                                                                                                	|
|     Lease Description             	|     Enter a lease description (such as, Ford F-150 ID:49320)                                                                                                                                                                                                                  	|
|     Fair Value of Asset           	|     Enter the fair value of the asset, normally included in   the contract for the lease. This is a required field, if the contract does   not contain a fair value figure, enter a fair value for a comparable asset.                                                    	|
|     Implicit Rate                 	|     Enter implicit rate of the lease. If this rate is not   provided in the terms of the lease, the user may chose to leave this field   empty as the borrowing rate will be used to discount the lease payments.                                                         	|
|     Incremental Borrowing Rate    	|     Public companies must enter incremental borrowing rate for   debt with similar risk and term profiles. Private companies may use the risk   free rate of a similar term to the lease.                                                                                 	|

|     Asset Useful Life             	|     Enter remaining periods of useful life from lease   commencement date. Note this is not the original useful life.                                                                                                                                                     	|
|     Deferred Rent Carryover       	|     Enter the deferred rent carryover amount for operating   leases that were previously modified. This deferred rent carryover will be   used to calculate the straight-line cost over this lease. The beginning   balance of deferred rent will include this amount.    	|
|     Transfer of Ownership         	|     Select “Yes” if lease transfers ownership at the end of   the term, otherwise select “No”                                                                                                                                                                             	|
|     Unique Asset           	|     US GAAP Only - Select "Yes" if the underlying   asset is of such a specialized nature that it is expected to have no   alternative use to the lessor at the end of the lease term. The lease will   then be classified as finance.                                                                                                                                                                                                    	|
|     Lease Group            	|     Select the lease group of the lease. Lease group will be   important for reporting purposes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          	|
|     Annuity Type           	|     Select the annuity type. This field is to determine if the   lease is due at the beginning of the payment period or at the end of the   period used to discount the lease payments.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   	|
|     Currency               	|     Select currency type.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	|
|     Vendor Account         	|     Select vendor. This should be a pre-determined vendor set   up through the AP module. Once invoices are created for the lease payment,   they will be created to the name of this vendor.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             	|
|     Fixed Asset Number     	|     Select the corresponding fixed asset number from the Fixed   Asset module. If a fixed asset number is selected, the fixed asset amount   will be updated given the lease inputs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      	|
|     Initial Direct Cost    	|     Initial direct costs are incremental costs of a lease that   would not have been incurred had the lease not been executed. Costs directly   or indirectly attributable to negotiating and arranging the lease (e.g., external   legal costs to draft or negotiate a lease or an allocation of internal legal   costs) are not considered initial direct costs. Indirect costs are not   capitalized, but expensed as period costs.    	|
|     Lease Incentives       	|     Lease incentives are payments made by the lessor to the   company to incentivize the signing of the lease. These amounts will be   subtracted from the ROU asset calculations.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        	|
|     Lease Prepayments      	|     Lease prepayments are payments made to the lessor prior to   the commencement date. These costs will be added to the ROU Asset but not the   lease liability.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         	|
|     Dismantling Costs      	|     Applicable to IFRS 16 users only, dismantling costs are   the estimated costs to dismantle and remove the underlying asset at the   expiration of the lease. These costs will be added to the ROU asset. US GAAP   should not enter an amount in this field as it will incorrectly calculate the   ROU Asset.                                                                                                                         	|
|     Residual Value Guarantee     	|     Enter any guaranteed residual value amount to be paid from   the lessee to the lessor at the end of the lease. If a lease contains a   provision that provides the lessor with the right to require the lessee to   purchase the underlying asset by the end of the lease term, the stated   purchase price should be included in lease payments. This is because the   purchase price is effectively a residual value guarantee that the lessee is   required to pay (i.e., the payment of the purchase price is outside of the   lessee’s control).    	|
|     Commencement Date            	|     Enter date the lease will be posted.      	|
|     Delivery Date                	|     Enter the date the asset will be delivered.                   	|
|     Contract Signature Date      	|     Enter the date the contract was signed.                	|
|     Lease Expiration/End Date    	|     Enter the date the lease expires. Note: the only logic   associated with this field is within the Leases Expiring Query. The query   uses this date to determine which leases to show in the form based on the   criteria entered.                            	|
|     Location Opening Date        	|     Enter the date of the expected opening of the location                                                                                                                                                                                                                 	|
|     Index Rate tab               	|                    	|
|     Index Rate Type              	|     If the lease payments are dependent on the rate fluctuations   of an index rate, select the index rate from the drop-down menu. The   drop-down menu is populated with the index rates inputted in the Index Rate   Types setup page                              	|
|     Revaluation Date             	|     Specify the first date that lease payments will be   revalued. This will populate based on the commencement date and months   between revaluation but can be edited.                                          	|
|     Index Rate (%)               	|     Enter the value of the index rate at the lease   commencement date. This value will be used to remeasure lease payments when   the index revaluation process is run.                 	|
|     For IFRS 16 leases – Lease payment changes due to a change   in index rates constitute a lease adjustment.              	|          	|
|                                                                                                                             	|          	|
|     For   ASC842 leases – Only the variable payments are affected when payments change   due to a change in index rates.    	|          	|
|     Months Between   Revaluations    	|     Specify   the number of months between the revaluation of the index rate                                                                                                                                                                           	|
|     Manually   Revalue               	|     Select   “No” to include the lease in the index revaluation process. Select “Yes” and   the index revaluation will only be adjusted if the user manually adjusts the   lease payments to account for the new index rate.                           	|
|     Allow   Decreases                	|     Select   “Yes” if lease payments should change if the index rate decreases. Select   “No” if only increases in the index rate will affect lease payments.                                                                                          	|
|     Limit   on Rate Increase (%)     	|     Input   the percentage increase limitation if the lease contains a limitation on the   amount payments can increase. Inputs will be divided by 100. For example, a   5% increase limit will be entered as “5”. If there is no limit, enter “0”.    	|
|     Index Change   to Apply (%)      	|     This   field determines the percent of the index rate increase/decrease that will be   applied to the lease payments.                                                                                                                              	|
|     Index   Rate Clause              	|     If   information about adjustments due to changes in the index rate is included in   the lease, state the clause here.                                                                                                                             	|

1. Once the lease information is entered, click **Create schedules**. This will generate the lease book(s), which will include the payment, amortization, depreciation, and expense schedules.
2. To access the lease books and view the newly created schedules, click the **Books** tab.
3. The **Book Details** page shows how the lease is being accounted for by the book(s) that has been allocated to it. From here, you can view the lease schedules.

   The payment schedule contains the inputs from the **Payment schedule lines** tab on the **Add Lease** page. You can still change each payment amount and variable payment. The measurement of the lease liability is calculated based on the modified payment schedule.

   After reviewing the payment schedule, click **Confirm schedule**. The lease won't be available for editing after the schedule is confirmed. 

> [!Note]
> The application automatically calculates the lease term from the payment schedule lines on the create lease form.

In order to calculate the lease term in months, the system will find the difference between the start date and the end date for a particular payment schedule line and will then move to the next payment schedule line, and find the difference again. Then the system sums all these amounts to determine the lease term in months.

1.	Click **Liability amortization schedule**.
2.	Exit the amortization schedule and **Asset depreciation schedule**.
be 3.	Exit the depreciation schedule and click **Initial recognition** to create the initial recognition journal entry. A prompt that shows that the journal has been created will displayed.

> [!Note]
> The journal entry is not posted to General ledger until the user manually "posts" the entry.

4.	Click **Asset leasing journal** to view and post the proposed initial recognition entry.

## Copy a Lease

Asset leasing lets you copy the details of a lease to create a new lease with the same information. You can change the lease fields before creating the schedules of the copied lease.

1. To copy a lease, select the lease to be copied from the **Lease summary** and select **Copy lease** in the top ribbon.

 > [!Note]
 > If the **Manual** parameter on the lease ID Number sequence is disabled, the copied lease will automatically generate the next number in the sequence to use for its lease ID. If this parameter is enabled, a message will be displayed that prompts you to enter the Lease ID before proceeding with copying the lease.
 
2. When you click **Copy**, the lease details from the selected lease will be copied over into a new lease where the user can edit the details before saving and creating the lease schedules.

Asset leasing is an advanced capability for managing, tracking and automating financial transactions for leased assets in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance. The asset leasing module complies with International accounting standards (IFRS 16) and US GAAP standards (ASC 842). Asset leasing captures and processes significant information about the lease and help in generating journal entries for the lifecycle of the lease, from initial recognition, monthly journal entries, to impairment and termination of the lease. Asset leasing integrates seamlessly with other components of Dynamics 365 Finance, including Fixed assets, Accounts payable and General ledger.

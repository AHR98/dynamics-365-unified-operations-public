# Budget plan narrative

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

When you're planning publishing budget books or documents, it's sometimes necessary to include a description and/or a revenue summary in a budget plan.  This information can include a description of the budget plan, or a list of assumptions, performance measures, revenue information, or proposed changes to services that led to the amounts on specific budget lines.  This feature will enable budget planners to document the considerations that went into creating the plan using an HTML editor control.   
 
You can use the control to write new content or paste content written and formatted in another text editor, such as Word. The narrative area lets changes fonts and text formatting. Additional features, including a spell checker, can also be turned on.
 
The content that's added to these two sections can be printed separately in a budget plan narrative report.
 
## Setting up the Budget Plan narrative
Complete the following steps to turn on the budget plan narrative area and use the most current HTML editor that's available in the product.
1.	Enable the **Budget plan narrative** under feature management.
a.	You can also enable the **New HTML editor control** in the **Feature management** workspace to use a more current editor.
2.	In the **Budget planning module**, select a budget plan and enter the necessary information for the budget plan header.
3.	Expand the **Budget plan narrative** section and add descriptions or revenue information that should be included in the budget plan.
 
The permission for modifying the budget plan narrative is the same as that for modifying budget lines. That permission is set using the **Budget plan process** page (**Budget > Setup > Budget Planning > Budget plan process**).

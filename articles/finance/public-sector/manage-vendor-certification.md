This topic describes the steps that vendors can use to  maintain their certifications using the **Vendor collaboration workspace**. Examples of certifications might include a Woman Business Enterprise (WBE) or a Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) company. Vendors will need to enter certification information in the **Vendor information** workspace. From there, vendors will select **More details**, and then select **Certifications**.

To add a new certification, select the **Add** button that is located above the **Certification** grid in the **Vendor information** workspace. Enter the following information:
 
- Certification number
- Certification type
- Certifying organization 
- Certification date
- Liability amount, if applicable
- Effective date
- Expiration date
- Comments, optional

If there are documents related to the specific certification, you can attach them by selecting the **Document** button.

Certifications that are entered by the vendor on this page will be assigned a source of “Vendor”. You can enter certificate information on the vendors behalf under vendor bank accounts. The information will display here and the source will display as **Customer**.

Vendors can edit or delete their certifications as needed.

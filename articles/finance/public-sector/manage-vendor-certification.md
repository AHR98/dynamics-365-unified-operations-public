# Maintain vendor certification
 
This topic describes the steps that vendorts can use to  maintain their certifications using the **Vendor collaboration workspace**. Examples of certifications might include a Woman Business Enterprise (WBE) or Minority and Small Business Certification or a Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) company.  This is performed in the Vendor information workspace. From here vendors will select More details and Certifications. 

To add a new certification, click the Add button above the certification grid. 
 
	• Enter a certification number
	
	• Select Certification type from the available list.
	
	• Select a Certifying organization from the available list 
	
	• Enter a Certification date. 
	
	• Enter a Liability amount if applicable. 
	
	• Enter an Effective date. 
	
	• Enter an Expiration date.  
	
	• Comments are optional.
 
If there are documents related to the specific certification, you can attach them by clicking on the Document button.     

Certifications entered by the vendor on this form will have a source of “Vendor”. The customer can also enter certificate information on the vendors behalf under vendor bank accounts, and the information will display here and the source will display Customer.
 
Vendors may remove or edit certifications as necessary.

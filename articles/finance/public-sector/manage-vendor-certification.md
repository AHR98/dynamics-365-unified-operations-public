This topic describes the steps that vendors can use to  maintain their certifications using the **Vendor collaboration workspace**. Examples of certifications might include a Woman Business Enterprise (WBE) or Minority and Small Business Certification or a Leadership in Energy and Environment Design (LEED) company. Vendors will begin entering certification information in the **Vendor information** workspace. From there vendors will select **More details**, and the select **Certifications**.

To add a new certification, click the **Add** button that's located above the **Certification** grid. Vendors can enter the following information.
 
- Enter a certification number
- Select certification type from the available list.
- Select a certifying organization from the available list 
- Enter a certification date. 
- Enter a liability amount if applicable. 
- Enter an effective date. 
- Enter an expiration date.  
- Comments are optional.<br> 

If there are documents related to the specific certification, you can attach them by clicking the **Document** button.

Certifications that are entered by the vendor on this page will be assigned a source of “Vendor”. You can enter certificate information on the vendors behalf under vendor bank accounts, and the information will display here and the source will display **Customer**.
 
Vendors can edit or delete their certifications as needed.

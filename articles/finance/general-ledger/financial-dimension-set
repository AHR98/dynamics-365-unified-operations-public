# Financial dimension sets

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes various information related to financial dimension sets.

Use the **Financial dimension sets** page to create and manage financial dimension sets.

A dimension set is an ordered list of financial dimensions that can be used to summarize general ledger data in a user-defined way. The dimension set that contains only the main account is the only standard dimension set.

A primary use of a dimension set is to define a trial balance.

## Dimension set balances

A dimension set can have balances that are based on the financial dimensions of the dimension set. The balances exist and are summarized from the general ledger data to improve performance related to retrieving the balances.

## Create balances

Use **Create balances** to initialize the balances on a dimension set that does not currently have balances.

> [!NOTE]
> Limit the number of dimension sets with balances because updating the balances has an impact on all general ledger posting activities.

## Update balances

Use **Update balances** to include the latest general ledger posting activity in the balances. Updating balances is a light operations and only has to process the general ledger posting activity since the last update.

> [!NOTE]
> Displaying the trial balance forces an update to make sure the balances are current. Consider using a recurring batch job to make sure updates to your most frequently used dimension sets are quick because that will minimize the wait for the trial balance user.

## Rebuild balances

Use **Rebuild balances** to recreate the balances from scratch, ensuring they match the general ledger data. Rebuilding balances is a heavy operation and should not normally be necessary.

> [!NOTE]
> If you have a scenario that regularly requires rebuilding balances, open a support case to determine why the balances do not match the general ledger data for your scenario.

## Clear balances

Use **Clear balances** to remove the balances and stop any further updates. The dimension set will no longer have an impact on general ledger posting activities.

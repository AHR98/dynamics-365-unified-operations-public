# Import subsidiary data from files

[!includeÂ banner] 

This topic lists the steps for preparing data from external systems to be imported to Dynamics 365 Finance. The **Consolidate with Import** page is used to prepare for the transfer of subsidiary data from external systems.

1. Start by preparing a new legal entity in the consolidatin process and Set up a subsidiary legal entity for consolidation. For information about creating legal entities, see [Create a legal entity](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/tasks/create-legal-entity.md).

*For more information see [Prepare a legal entity for use in the consolidation process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/prepare-a-legal-entity-for-use-in-the-consolidation-process) and [Set up a subsidiary legal entity for consolidation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/set-up-a-subsidiary-legal-entity-for-consolidation).* 

2. Prepare your import file. For more information, see [Data import and export jobs overview](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-import-export-job.md).

3. Perform the steps to **Export Subsidiary data to file** as outlined above. You can use this step to consolidate data from another instance of Dynnamics 365 Finance, or from Business Central.
		b. For data from external systems, data will need to be formatted to this format

4. Open the **Consolidate with import** page (**Consolidations > Consolidate with Import)**. On the **Criteria** tab, specify the details of the report, and/or the import, as follows.

7. Set the **Run in background** field to **Yes** to let the import process run in the background.

8. Set the **Batch Processing** field to **Yes** to run the consolidation as a batch job at a specific time. To run the consolidate immediately, click **OK**. 
			
   The transactions and balances that were specified for consolidation in the subsidiaries are added to the appropriate accounts in the consolidated legal entity.

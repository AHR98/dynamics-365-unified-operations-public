# Import subsidiary data from files

[!includeÂ banner] 

This topic lists the steps for preparing data from external systems so that it can be imported into Dynamics 365 Finance. Use the **Consolidate with Import** page to prepare for the transfer of subsidiary data from external systems.

1. Prepare for the consolidation process by creating up a subsidiary legal entity for the consolidation. For information about creating legal entities, see [Create a legal entity](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/organization-administration/tasks/create-legal-entity.md).

*For more information see [Prepare a legal entity for use in the consolidation process](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/prepare-a-legal-entity-for-use-in-the-consolidation-process) and [Set up a subsidiary legal entity for consolidation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/set-up-a-subsidiary-legal-entity-for-consolidation). These are AX 2012 topics, which aren't maintained anymore. I tried to find alternate topics in Dynamics 365.* 

2. Prepare file that will contain the data to be imported. For more information about the import process, see [Data import and export jobs overview](../../fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/data-import-export-job.md).

3. Complete the steps to **Export Subsidiary data to file** as outlined above. (*Is Export subsidiary data to file a page in Dynamics? If so, it doesn't work to say complete the steps in a page/form in the product. I didn't find a procedure to link to that walks through exporting subsidiary data to a file. Maybe it's there and I didn't find it. But if not, maybe would should write that topic too, or migrate it from AX 2012 if it's there.*) You can use this process to consolidate data from another instance of Dynnamics 365 Finance, or from Business Central. If you're importing data from external systems, data will need to be formatted to this format. 

4. Open the **Consolidate with import** page (**Consolidations > Consolidate with Import)**. On the **Criteria** tab, specify the details of the report, and/or the import, as follows.

7. Set the **Run in background** field to **Yes** to let the import process run in the background.

8. Set the **Batch Processing** field to **Yes** to run the consolidation as a batch job at a specific time. To run the consolidate immediately, click **OK**. 
			
   The transactions and balances that were specified for consolidation in the subsidiaries are added to the appropriate accounts in the consolidated legal entity.

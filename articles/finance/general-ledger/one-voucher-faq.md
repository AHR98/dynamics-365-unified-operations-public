# One Voucher FAQ

This topic answers questions that we've addressed about the One voucher functionality. One voucher for financial journals lets you enter multiple subledger transactions in the context of a single voucher. The journals that you can include in that one voucher can be general journal, fixed asset journal, vendor payment journal, among others.

## When will the One voucher functionality be deprecated?  
We cannot provide an accurate estimate of when the One voucher functionality will be deprecated, but It will likely be at least two years before the functionality is deprecated.  As noted in the One voucher documentation, numerous business requirements can only be accomplished by using One voucher.  Microsoft must ensure that all the identified business requirements can still be accomplished within the system after deprecating the functionality. This will likely include the addition of new features to fill functional gaps.  After all functional gaps are filled, Microsoft will communicate that the feature will be deprecated, with the deprecation being at least one year after the communication.  For more information, see the [One voucher documentation](one-voucher.md).

## What will the solution look like for replacing One voucher?
We can't provide a specific solution because each feature gap is unique and has to be evaluated based on the business requirements. Some functional gaps will likely be replaced with features for specific business processes, while other gaps may be filled by still allowing the entry into a journal in a manner that's similar to One voucher, but enhancing the system to track more detail, as needed.  

## Where do we find the progress of the feature gaps being filled?
As with every new feature, customers must watch the Release plan and Whatâ€™s new documentation. Each feature will be added to these documents, with a note identifying the feature as necessary to fill a business requirement that previously required the One voucher functionality.  

## When the deprecation date is identified, where will it be communicated?
The deprecation of One voucher is a significant change that will be widely communicated. It will be communicated through the product documentation, a blog post, and announced at applicable Microsoft conferences well in advance the deprecation taking effect.

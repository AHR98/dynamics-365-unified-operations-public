# One Voucher FAQ

This topic answers a number of questions that we've addressed about the One voucher functionality. One voucher for financial journals (general journal, fixed asset journal, vendor payment journal, and so on) lets you enter multiple subledger transactions in the context of a single voucher.

## When will the One voucher functionality be deprecated?  
We cannot provide an ETA of when the One voucher functionality will be deprecated, but It will likely be two or more years before the functionality is deprecated.  As noted in the external documentation, numerous business requirements can only be accomplished by using One voucher.  Microsoft must ensure that all the identified business requirements can still be accomplished within the system after deprecating the functionality. This will likely include the addition of new features to fill functional gaps.  After all functional gaps are filled, Microsoft will communicate that the feature will be deprecated, with the deprecation being at least one year after the communication.  

## What will the solution look like for replacing One voucher?
We cannot provide a specific solution because each feature gap is different and has to be evaluated based on the business requirements. Some functional gaps will likely be replaced with features specifically for the business process, while other gaps may be filled by still allowing the entry into a journal similar to using One voucher, but enhancing the system to track more detail as necessary.  

## Where do we find the progress of the feature gaps being filled?
As with every new feature, customers must watch the Release plan and Whatâ€™s new documentation.  Each feature will be added to these documents, with a note identifying the feature as necessary to fill a business requirement that previously required the One voucher functionality.  

## When the deprecation date is identified, where will it be communicated?
The deprecation of One voucher is a large breaking change that will be widely communicated.  The published documentation will be updated.  A blog will be created. The Deprecation documentation will be updated.  It will be communicated at all conferences well in advance.

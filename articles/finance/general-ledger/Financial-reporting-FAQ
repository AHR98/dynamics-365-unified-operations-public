## How to restrict access to a report using Tree Security

Scenario: The USMF Company has a Balance Sheet report that it doesn’t want all FR users to be able to view in D365. 
Solution: You can utilize Tree Security to restrict access to a single report so that only certain users can access the report. 

1.	Log into Financial Reporter Report Designer
2.	Create a new Tree Definition (File | New | Tree Definition)
  a.	On the Summary line in the “Unit Security” column double-click
      i.	Click Users and Groups  
          1.	Select the User(s) or Group that would like to access this report.

# Configure parameters for collection process automation

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes the parameters that affect automated collection processes and provides some guidance for setting them so that the automated process reflects your intentions and expectations. For information about automating collection processes, see [Collections process automation](collections-process-automate.md).

## General
Enter a number in the **Percentage of customers per batch task** to determine the number of batch tasks per automation process. Set **Post collection letters automatically** to Yes so the collection letter action type will post the letter during the automation. Set **Create activities for automations** to Yes to create and close activities for non-activity action types to view all automated steps taken on an account. Define the number of days collection history is stored in the **Days to keep collections process automation history**. When an invoice reaches the last step of the collections process it wonâ€™t be used to create future process automation action types if **Exclude invoice after activating last process step** is set to Yes. The next oldest invoice determines the next process automation step to ensure collection process automation actions continue. 

## Payment predictions
Starting in version 10.0.21, Customer payment predictions, found in Finance Insights, projects whether an invoice will be paid on time, late or very late. (You can configure each of those categories in Finance insights.) If invoices are predicted to be paid late it is advantageous to start the collections process before the invoice is due. Those predictions can be used to create collections activities when Collections process automations runs. Set **Enable payment predictions** to Yes to use customer payment predictions to create collections activities based on the probability the invoice will be paid late. 

> [!Note]
> For more information on Customer payment predictions and Finance insights, see [Customer payment predictions](payment-insights-overview.md).

When the customer payment predictions model runs, it assigns a percentage to the prediction of the invoice being paid on time, late or very late. You can use that information to start collection activities automatically using Collections process automation in cases where late payment is expected. You can view these percentages in the **Payment predictions per customer** or **Payment predictions per transaction** pages under **Credit and collections > Collections**. 

If the average payment prediction for a customer invoice is less than the benchmark percentage, no activity is created. If the invoice prediction is greater than or equal to the benchmark percentage, one activity is created per customer. For **Prediction:Late** enter the **Benchmark percentage** of when collections process automation should create collections activities. This is an aggregate value of both Late and Very late. Select a **Business document template** to use for the activity created or create a new one. This identifies the **Type**, **Purpose** and **Days until activity closed**. Enter any **Notes** that will default as the description when the activity is created. For **Prediction: Very Late** enter the **Benchmark percentage** of when collections process automation should create collections activities for a customer predicted to pay invoices Very late. Select a **Business document template** to use for the activity created. This identifies the **Type**, **Purpose** and **Days until activity closed**. Enter any **Notes** that will default as the description when the activity is created. 

### Example
The Prediction: The late benchmark percentage is set to 60%. When customer payment predictions runs for each invoice, it assigns a percentage prediction of being paid on time, late or very late. If the payment prediction that the invoice will be paid late is 59% or less, no collection activity will be created for the invoice by the auomated collection process. If the customer payment prediction for an invoice is greater than or equal to 60% then a collection activity is create during when Collections process automation runs. 

> [!Note]
> The very late prediction is evaluated before the late prediction since very late includes invoices that are predicted to be paid late. The collections process only generates one activity if the invoice falls into both late and very late benchmarks. In that case it uses the very late activity and business document because very late is prioritized higher. Any other actions that have already been generated will not be generated a second time.

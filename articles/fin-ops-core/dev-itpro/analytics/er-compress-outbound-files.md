# Compressing large documents that are generated with ER 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## Overview

You may use the [Electronic reporting (ER) framework](general-electronic-reporting.md) to configure a solution for fetching transactional data to generate an outbound document the final size of which may be quite large. When such a document is generated, the [AOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/dev-tools/access-instances#location-of-packages-source-code-and-other-aos-configurations) memory is used to keep it. When such a document has been generated, it must be downloaded from Finance application. Currently, the maximum size of a single document that is generated by using ER is limited by 2GB. Finance application currently also has 1GB [limitation](https://fix.lcs.dynamics.com/Issue/Details?bugId=489291) for maximum size of a downloaded file. So, you need to configure an ER solution
reducing the probability to exceed these limitations and get either **Stream was too long** or **Overflow or underflow in the arithmetic operation** exceptions.

For doing this, you can adjust your ER format in Operations designer by adding a new root element of the **Folder** type to compress the content that is generated by any nested element of it. Compression works just-in-time allowing to reduce peak memory usage and to reduce the size of a file that is finally downloaded.

>[!NOTE] Note that compression takes several additional percent of CPU usage.

For more information about this approach, complete the examples in this topic.

## Example: Compress an outbound document

This example shows how a user in the **System administrator** or **Electronic reporting functional consultant** role can configure an ER format to use compression of a generated document.

### Prerequisites

1.  [Activate a configuration
    provider](er-defer-xml-element.md#activate-a-configuration-provider).
2.  [Import the sample ER
    configurations](er-defer-xml-element.md#import-the-sample-er-configurations).
3.  [Review the imported
    format](er-defer-xml-element.md#review-the-imported-format).  
    
    > Note that currently the format structure starts from the **Report** element
    of the **File** type and contains XML elements. It means that an outbound document will be generated in XML format with no compression usage.

### Generate an ER format to get an uncompressed document

1.  [Run the imported
    format](er-defer-xml-element.md#run-the-imported-format).  
    
    > Note that the generated document in XML format is 3KB large.

### Modify the format to compress generated output

1.  Go to **Modules \> Organization administration \> Electronic reporting \> Configurations**.
2.  On the **Configurations** page, in the configuration tree, expand **Model to learn deferred elements**.
3.  Select the **Format to learn deferred XML elements** configurations.
4.  Select **Designer** to modify the format structure.
5.  On the **Format designer** page, on the **Format** tab, select **Add root** to insert a new root format element.
6.  In the **Add** popup page, select **Common\\Folder**.
7.  Select **OK** to confirm a new root element entry.
8.  Select **Save**.
    
    > Note that currently the format structure starts from the **Folder** type element. This element will generate an output as a compressed (zipped) file. Respectively, when a generated by the **Report** element document will be placed to an outbound zipped file, its content will be compressed reducing the size of an outbound file.

### Generate an ER format to get a compressed document

1.  On the **Format designer** page, select **Run**.
2.  Download the file that the web browser offers, and open it for review.

    > Note that the generated document in ZIP format is 1KB large. The compression of the XML file this ZIP file holds is 87%. Note that the compression ratio very much depends on the data being compressed.

> [!NOTE] Note that if the ER [destination](electronic-reporting-destinations.md) is configured for the format element that generates an output (**Report** element in the sample above), output compression will be bypassed.

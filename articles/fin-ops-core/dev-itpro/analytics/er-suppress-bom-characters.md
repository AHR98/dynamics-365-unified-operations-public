# Suppress BOM characters in generated files

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

You can design an [Electronic reporting (ER)](general-electronic-reporting.md) [solution](er-quick-start1-new-solution.md) to generate outgoing documents. To generate such documents as TEXT or XML files, this solution must include an ER [configuration](general-electronic-reporting.md#Configuration) that contains an ER [format](general-electronic-reporting.md#FormatComponentOutbound) component. To specify a desire [character encoding](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/win32/intl/character-sets) using to represent a repertoire of characters of a generated file, this ER format must contain the **Common\\File** format element. To configure the ER format component, you must open the [draft](general-electronic-reporting.md#component-versioning) version of the created ER configuration in the ER format designer. Then add the **Common\\File** element and specify in the **Encoding** field the desire encoding of an outbound file that will be generated by using this component at runtime.

> [!NOTE]
> An error is thrown when you save changes of settings of the format that contains the wrong encoding name.

When you specified UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 encoding, the **Suppress BOM characters** field is enabled. Set this field to **Yes** if you want to suppress [BOM characters](https://docs.microsoft.com/globalization/encoding/byte-order-mark) in an outbound file that is generated at runtime when the editable ER format is executed.

> [!NOTE]
> When the **Encoding** field remains blank, the default UTF-8 encoding is used.

To review this functionality at runtime, complete the steps of one of the available procedures that suites for this. For example, complete the steps of the [Defer the execution of XML elements in ER formats](er-defer-xml-element.md) procedure. When you completed the steps of the [Modify the format so that the calculation is based on generated output](er-defer-xml-element.md#modify-the-format-so-that-the-calculation-is-based-on-generated-output) sub-task, complete the following additional steps:

1.  Specify the UTF encoding:
    +   Select the **Report** element of the **Common\\File** type.
    +   In the **Encoding** field, specify the UTF-8 encoding.
2.  Generate an XML file with BOM characters:
    +   Set the **Suppress BOM characters** field to **No** to place BOM characters to a generated XML file.
    +   Complete the steps of the [Defer the execution of the summary XML element so that the calculated total is used](er-defer-xml-element.md#defer-the-execution-of-the-summary-xml-element-so-that-the-calculated-total-is-used) sub-task and save the generated file as SampleXmlReport.xml.
3.  Generate an XML file without BOM characters:
    +   Set the **Suppress BOM characters** field to **Yes** to suppress BOM characters in a generated XML file.
    +   Complete the steps of the [Defer the execution of the summary XML element so that the calculated total is used](er-defer-xml-element.md#defer-the-execution-of-the-summary-xml-element-so-that-the-calculated-total-is-used) sub-task and save the generated file as SampleXmlReport (1).xml.
4.  Compare the generated files.

> [!NOTE]
> Note that the first difference is in the file header: the SampleXmlReport.xml file contains BOM characters while the SampleXmlReport (1).xml one does not.

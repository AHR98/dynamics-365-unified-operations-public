# Inspect the configured ER component to prevent potential runtime issues

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

Every configured [Electronic reporting (ER)](general-electronic-reporting.md) [format](general-electronic-reporting.md#FormatComponentOutbound) and [model mapping](general-electronic-reporting.md#data-model-and-model-mapping-components) component can be [validated](er-fillable-excel.md#validate-an-er-format) at design time to complete the consistency check to prevent potential runtime issues including execution errors and performance degradation. For every discovered issue, the path to a problematic element is provided. For some of these issues, the automatic fix is offered.

By default, this validation is applied automatically in the following cases for an ER configuration that contains the ER components mentioned above:

- When you [import](general-electronic-reporting.md#importing-an-er-component-from-lcs-to-use-it-internally) a new [version](general-electronic-reporting.md#component-versioning) of an ER configuration to your Dynamics 365 Finance instance.
- When you change the [status](general-electronic-reporting.md#component-versioning) of the editable ER configuration from **Draft** to **Completed**.
- When you [rebase](general-electronic-reporting.md#upgrading-a-format-selecting-a-new-version-of-base-format-rebase) an editable ER configuration by applying a new base version.

You can explicitly run this validation. To do this, select one of the following three options, and complete the steps:

- Option 1
    1.  Go to **Organization administration \> Electronic reporting \> Configurations**.
    2.  In the configurations tree in the left pane, select the  ER configurations you want that contain the ER format or ER model mapping component.
    3.  On the **Versions** FastTab, select the version you want of the selected ER configuration.
    4.  On the **Configurations** page, on the Action Pane, select **Validate**.
    
- Option 2 for an ER format
    1.  Go to **Organization administration \> Electronic reporting \> Configurations** page.
    2.  In the configurations tree in the left pane, select the ER configurations you want that contain the ER format component.
    3.  On the **Versions** FastTab, select the version you want of the selected ER configuration.
    4.  On the **Configurations** page, on the Action Pane, select **Designer**.
    5.  On the **Format designer** page, on the Action Pane, select **Validate**.
    
- Option 3 for an ER model mapping
    1.  Go to **Organization administration \> Electronic reporting \> Configurations** page.
    2.  In the configurations tree in the left pane, select the ER configurations you want that contain the ER model mapping component.
    3.  On the **Versions** FastTab, select the version you want of the selected ER configuration.
    4.  On the **Configurations** page, on the Action Pane, select **Designer**.
    5.  On the **Model to datasource mapping** page, on the Action Pane, select **Designer**.
    6.  On the **Model mapping designer** page, on the Action Pane, select **Validate**.

You can skip this validation during the configuration's import. To do this, complete the following steps:

1.  Go to **Organization administration \> Electronic reporting \> Configurations** page.
2.  On the **Configurations** page, on the Action Pane, on the **Configurations** tab, in the **Advanced settings** group, select **User parameters**.
3.  Set the **Validate the configuration after importing** option to **No**.

You can also skip this validation during the version's status change or rebase. To do this, complete the following steps:

1.  Go to **Organization administration \> Electronic reporting \> Configurations** page.
2.  On the **Configurations** page, on the Action Pane, on the **Configurations** tab, in the **Advanced settings** group, select **User parameters**.
3.  Set the **Skip validation at configuration's status change and rebase** option to **Yes**.

ER groups consistency check inspections by the following categories:
 - **Executability**: Includes inspections that detect critical issues that may happen at runtime, mostly at an **Error** level. 
 - **Performance**: Includes inspections that detect issues that may cause non-efficient execution of configured ER components, mostly at a **Warning** level.
 - **Data integrity**: Includes inspections that detect issues that may cause data loss or runtime issues, mostly at a **Warning** level.

## <a name="i1">Type conversion</a>

ER checks whether the data type of a data model field is compatible with data type of an expression that is configured as the binding of this field. When the data types are incompatible, a validation error occurs in the ER model mapping designer stating that ER can't convert an expression of type A to a field of type B. The following steps show how this issue may occur.

1.  Start configuring the ER data model and the ER model mapping components simultaneously.
2.  In the data model tree, add a new field named **X**, select the **Integer** data type.
  
    ![Configure ER data model component on the Data model page](./media/er-components-inspections-01.png)

3.  In the **Model mapping data sourcesMM pane, add a new data source of the type, **Calculated field**.
4.  Name the data source **Y**, and configure it to contain the `INTVALUE(100)` expression.
5.  Bind **X** to **Y**.*
6.  In the data model designer, change the data type of **X** from **Integer** to **Int64**.
7.  Select **Validate** to inspect the editable model mapping component on the **Model mapping designer** page.

    ![Validate ER model mapping component on the Model mapping designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-01.gif)

8.  Select **Validate** to inspect the model mapping component of the selected ER configurations on the **Configurations** page.

    ![Validate ER model mapping component on the Configurations page](./media/er-components-inspections-01a.png)

    > [!NOTE]
    > A validation error occurs which states that the expression `INTVALUE(100)` of the data source **Y** returns the value of the **Integer** type that can't be stored in the **X** data model's field of the **Int64** type.

The following illustration shows the runtime error that occurs when you ignore this warning and select **Run** to execute a format that is configured to use this model mapping:

![Run the editable format on the Format designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-01b.png)

### Automatic resolution availability

The option to automatically resolve this issue is not available.

### Manual resolution

#### Option 1

Update the data model structure by changing data type of the data model field to make it equal to data type of the expression configured for the binding of this field. For the example above, the data type of field **X** must be changed back to **Integer**.

#### Option 2

Update the model mapping by changing the expression of the data source that is bound with the data model field. Using the example, the expression of the data source **Y** must be changed to `INT64VALUE(100)`.

## <a name="i2">Type compatibility</a>

ER checks if the data type of a format element is compatible with the data type of an expression that is configured as the binding of this format element. When they are incompatible, a validation error occurs in the ER Operations designer. The error states that the configured expression can't be used as the binding of the current format element to a data source. This is because the expression returns a value of data type A that is beyond the scope of data types supported by the current format element of type B. The following steps show how this issue may occur.

1.  Start configuring the ER data model and the ER format components simultaneously.
2.  In the data model tree, add a new field, name it **X** and select the **Integer** data type.
3.  In the format structure tree, add a new format element of the **Numeric** type.
4.  Name the new format element **Y**, and in the **Numeric type** field, select the **Integer** data type.
5.  Bind **X** to **Y**.
6.  In the format structure tree, change the **Numeric type** value of the **Y** format element from **Integer** to **Int64**.
7.  Select **Validate** to inspect the editable format component on the **Format designer** page.

    ![Validate ER format component on the Format designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-02.gif)

    > [!NOTE]
    > A validation error occurs that states the configured expression can only accept **Int64** values. The format element **Y** can't be populated with the value of the data model's field **X** of the **Integer** type.

### Automatic resolution availability

The option to automatically resolve this issue is not available.

### Manual resolution

#### Option 1

Update the format structure by changing data type of the **Numeric** format element to make it equal to the data type of the expression configured for the binding of this element. In the example above, the **Numeric type** value of the format element **X** must be changed back to **Integer**.

#### Option 2

Update the format mapping of the format element **X** by changing the expression from `model.X` to `INT64VALUE(model.X)`.

## <a name="i3">Missing configuration element</a>

ER checks if the binding expressions contains only data sources that are configured in the editable ER component. The validation error occurs in the ER Operations designer or the ER model mapping designer for every binding that contains a data source that is missing in the editable ER component.

1.  Start configuring the ER data model and the ER model mapping components simultaneously.
2.  In the data model tree, add a new field, name it **X**, and select the **Integer** data type.

    ![Configure ER data model component on the Data model page](./media/er-components-inspections-01.png)

3.  In the model mapping data sources pane, add a new data source of the *Calculated field* type and name it **Y**.
4.  Configure it as containing the `INTVALUE(100)` expression.
5.  Bind **X** to **Y**.
6.  In the model mapping designer, on the data sources pane, delete the data source **Y**.
7.  Select **Validate** to inspect the editable model mapping component on the **Model mapping designer** page.

    ![Validate ER model mapping component on the Model mapping designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-03.gif)

    > [!NOTE]
    > A validation error occurs which states that the path to the data source **Y** is not found while this data source is used in the binding of the **X** data model's field.

### Automatic resolution availability

The **Unbind** option is offered to automatically resolve this issue. When you selected this option, the missing data source binding is removed.

### Manual resolution

#### Option 1

Unbind the data model **X** field to stop referring to the non-existing data source **Y**.

#### Option 2

Add back the data source **Y** on the data sources pane of the ER model mapping designer.

## <a name="i4">Executability of an expression containing the FILTER function</a>

The built-in ER function [FILTER](er-functions-list-filter.md) is used to access application tables, views, or data entities by placing a single SQL call to get required data as the list of records. A data source of the type **Record list** is used as an argument of this function to specify a particular application source for this call. ER checks whether a direct SQL query to a data source that is referred in the FILTER function can be established. When the referred data source can't be queried by SQL, a validation error occurs in the ER model mapping designer stating that the ER expression with the FILTER function can't be executed at runtime. The following steps show how this issue may occur.

1.  Start configuring the ER model mapping component.
2.  Add a new data source of the type, **Dynamics 365 for Operations \ Table records**.
    - Name the data source **Vendor**.
    - In the **Table** field, select **VendTable** to specify that this data source will request the **VendTable** table.
3.  Add a new data source of the type, **Calculated field**.
    - Name the data source **FilteredVendor**.
    - Configure the data source to contain the expression `FILTER(Vendor, Vendor.AccountNum="US-101")`.
4.  Select **Validate** to inspect the editable model mapping component on the **Model mapping designer** page to verify that the `FILTER(Vendor, Vendor.AccountNum="US-101")` expression in the **Vendor** data source can be queried.
5.  Modify the **Vendor** data source by adding a new nested field of the type, **Calculated field** the get the trimmed vendor account number.
    - Name the nested field **$AccNumber**.
    - Configure the field to contain the expression `TRIM(Vendor.AccountNum)`.
6.  Select **Validate** to inspect the editable model mapping component on the **Model mapping designer** page and verify that the `FILTER(Vendor, Vendor.AccountNum="US-101")` expression in the **Vendor** data source can be queried.

    ![Validate ER model mapping component on the Model mapping designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-04.gif)

    >[!NOTE]
    > The validation error occurs because the **Vendor** data source contains a nested field of the type **Calculated field** that doesn't allow the expression of the **FilteredVendor** data source to be translated to the direct SQL statement.

The following illustration shows the runtime error that occurs when you ignore this warning and select **Run** to execute a format that is configured to use this model mapping.

![Run the editable format on the Format designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-04a.png)

### Automatic resolution availability

The option to automatically resolve this issue isn't offered.

### Manual resolution

#### Option 1

Instead of adding a nested field of the type, **Calculated field** for the **Vendor** data source, add the **$AccNumber** for the **FilteredVendor** data source and configure its expression as `TRIM(FilteredVendor.AccountNum)`. This will allow the `FILTER(Vendor, Vendor.AccountNum="US-101")` expression to be executed at the SQL level and calculate the nested **$AccNumber** field after.

#### Option 2

Change the **FilteredVendor** expression from `FILTER(Vendor, Vendor.AccountNum="US-101")` to `WHERE(Vendor, Vendor.AccountNum="US-101")`. Changing the expression isn't recommended for a table with a large volume of data (transactional tables) because all records will be fetched, and the selection of the required records will be performed in memory. This can be a cause of poor performance. For more information, see [WHERE ER function](er-functions-list-where.md).

## <a name="i5">Executability of a GROUPBY data source</a>

The GROUPBY data source divides the query result into groups of records, usually for the purpose of performing one or more aggregations on each group. Every GROUPBY data source can be configured as executed either on database level or in memory. When a GROUPBY data source is configured to be executed on database level, ER checks whether a direct SQL query can be established to a data source that is referred in this data source. When the referred data source is not SQL queryable, a validation error occurs in the ER model mapping designer stating that the configured GROUPBY data source can't be executed at runtime. The follwoing steps show how this issue may occur.

1.  Start configuring the ER model mapping component.
2.  Add a new data source of the type, **Dynamics 365 for Operations \ Table records**.
    - Name the data source **Trans**.
    - In the **Table** field, select **VendTrans** to specify that this data source will request the **VendTrans** table.
3.  Add a new data source of the type, **Group by**.
    - Name the data source **GroupedTrans**.
    - Configure the data source as follows:
        - Select the **Trans** data source as the source of records to be grouped.
        - Select the **Query** value in the **Execution location** field to indicate that you want to execute this data source on database level.

        ![Configure a data source on the Edit 'Group By' parameters page](./media/er-components-inspections-05a.gif)

4.  Select **Validate** to inspect the editable model mapping component on the **Model mapping designer** page and verify that the configured **GroupedTrans** data source can be queried.
5.  Modify the **Trans** data source by adding a new nested field of the type **Calculated field** to get the trimmed vendor account number.
    - Name the data source **$AccNumber**.
    - Configure the data source as containing the expression,`TRIM(Trans.AccountNum)`.

        ![Configure a data source on the Model mapping designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-05a.png)

6.  Select **Validate** to inspect the editable model mapping component on the **Model mapping designer** page to verify that the configured **GroupedTrans** data source can be queried.

    ![Validate ER model mapping component on the Model mapping designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-05b.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    > The validation error occurs because the **Trans** data source contains a nested field of the type **Calculated field** that doesn't allow the call for the **GroupedTrans** data source to be translated to the direct SQL statement.

The following illustration shows the runtime error that occurs when you ignore this warning and select **Run** to execute a format that is configured to use this model mapping.

![Run the editable format on the Format designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-05c.png)

### Automatic resolution availability

The option to automatically resolve this issue isn't offered.

### Manual resolution

#### Option 1

Instead of adding a nested field of the type, **Calculated field** to the **Trans** data source, add the **$AccNumber** for the **GroupedTrans.lines** item of the **GroupedTrans** data source and configure its expression as TRIM(GroupedTrans.lines.AccountNum). The **GroupedTrans** data source can then be executed on the SQL level and calculate the nested **$AccNumber** field after.

#### Option 2

Change the value of the **Execution location** field for the **GroupedTrans** data source from **Query** to **In memory**. Changing the value isn't recommended for a table containing the large volume of data (transactional tables) because all records will be fetched, and the grouping and aggregations will be performed in memory. This can be a cause of poor performance.

## <a name="i6">Executability of a JOIN data source</a>

The [JOIN](er-join-data-sources.md) data source combines records from two or more database tables based on related fields. Every JOIN data source can be configured as executed on the database level or in memory. When a JOIN data source is configured to be executed on the database level, ER checks whether a direct SQL query can be established to data sources that are referred in this data source. When at least one referred data source can't be queried by SQL, the validation error occurs in the ER model mapping designer stating that the configured JOIN data source can't be executed at runtime. The following steps show how this issue may occur.

1.  Start configuring the ER model mapping component.
2.  Add a new data source of the type, **Dynamics 365 for Operations \ Table records**.
    - Name the data source **Vendor**.
    - In the **Table** field, select **VendTable** to specify that this data source will request the **VendTable** table.
3.  Add a new data source of the type, **Dynamics 365 for Operations \ Table records**.
    - Name the data source **Trans**.
    - In the **Table** field, select **VendTrans** to specify that this data source will request the **VendTrans** table.
4.  Add a new data source of the type, **Calculated field** as the nested field of the **Vendor** data source.
    -  Name the data source **FilteredTrans**.
    - Configure the data source to contain the expression, `FILTER(Trans, Trans.AccountNum=Vendor.AccountNum)`.
5.  Add a new data source of the type **Join**.
    - Name the data source **JoinedList**.
    - Configure the data source as follows:
        - Add the **Vendor** data source as the first set of records to join.
        - Add the **Vendor.FilteredTrans** data source as the second set of records to join selecting the **INNER** type.
        - Select the **Query** value in the **Execute** field to indicate that you want to execute this data source on database level.

        ![Configure a data source on the Join designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-06a.gif)

6.  Select **Validate** to inspect the editable model mapping component on the **Model mapping designer** page to verify the configured **JoinedList** data source can be queried.
7.  Modify the expression of the **Vendor.FilteredTrans** data source from `FILTER(Trans, Trans.AccountNum=Vendor.AccountNum)` to `WHERE(Trans, Trans.AccountNum=Vendor.AccountNum)`.
8.  Select **Validate** to inspect the editable model mapping component on the **Model mapping designer** page to verify the configured **JoinedList** data source can be queried.

### Automatic resolution availability

The option to automatically resolve this issue isn't offered.

### Manual resolution

#### Option 1

Modify the expression of the **Vendor.FilteredTrans** data source from `WHERE(Trans, Trans.AccountNum=Vendor.AccountNum)` back to `FILTER(Trans, Trans.AccountNum=Vendor.AccountNum)` as the warning advised.

![Validate ER model mapping component on the Model mapping designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-06d.png)

#### Option 2

Change the value of the **Execute** field for the **JoinedList** data source from **Query** to **In memory**. It is not recommended for a table containing the large volume of data (transactional tables) - all records will be fetched, and the join will be performed in memory. This can be a cause of poor performance. The appropriate validation warning is thrown informing about this risk.

## <a name="i7">Preference of FILTER vs. WHERE function</a>

The built-in ER function [FILTER](er-functions-list-filter.md), is used to access application tables, views, or data entities by placing a single SQL call to get required data as the list of records. The [WHERE](er-functions-list-where.md) function fetches all records from the given source and performs record selection in memory. A data source of the type, **Record list** is used as an argument of both functions to specify a particular source for getting records. ER checks whether the direct SQL call to a data source that is referred in the **WHERE** function can be established. When the referred data source can be queried in SQL, the validation warning occurs in the ER model mapping designer suggesting that you use the **FILTER** function instead of **WHERE** for efficiency reasons. The following steps show how this issue may occur.

1.  Start configuring the ER model mapping component.
2.  Add a new data source of the type, **Dynamics 365 for Operations \ Table records**.
    - Name the new data source **Trans**.
    - In the **Table** field, select **VendTrans** to specify that this data source will request the **VendTrans** table.
3.  Add a new data source of the type, **Calculated field** as the nested field of the **Vendor** data source.
    - Name the new data source **FilteredTrans**.
    - Configure the data source to contain the expression, `WHERE(Trans, Trans.AccountNum="US-101")`.
4.  Add a new data source of the type, **Dynamics 365 for Operations \ Table records**.
    - Name name the new data source **Vendor**.
    - In the **Table** field, select **VendTable** to specify that this data source will request the **VendTable** table.
5.  Add a new data source of the type, **Calculated field**.
    - Name the data source **FilteredVendor**.
    - Configure teh data source to contain the expression, `WHERE(Vendor, Vendor.AccountNum="US-101")`.
6.  Select **Validate** to inspect the editable model mapping component on the **Model mapping designer** page.

    ![Validate ER model mapping component on the Model mapping designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-07a.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    > The validation warnings state that it is preferrable to use the **FILTER** function instead of **WHERE** for the **FilteredVendor** and **FilteredTrans** data sources.

    ![Validate ER model mapping component on the Model mapping designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-07b.png)

### Automatic resolution availability

Select **Fix** to automatically replace the **WHERE** function with **FILTER** in an expression of every data source that has been encountered in the  **Warning** grid for this kind of inspection.

You can check a single warning in the **Warning** grid and select the **Fix selected** option to automatically change the only expression of a data source that is mentioned in the checked warning.

![Validate ER model mapping component on the Model mapping designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-07c.png)

### Manual resolution

You can manually adjust expressions of all the data sources mentioned in the validation grid by replacing the **WHERE** function with **FILTER**.  

## <a name="i8">Preferability of ALLITEMSQUERY vs. ALLITEMS function</a>

The built-in ER functions [ALLITEMS](er-functions-list-allitems.md) and [ALLITEMSQUERY](er-functions-list-allitemsquery.md) are used to get the flattened **Record list** value that consists of a list of records that represent all items that match the specified path. ER checks whether the direct SQL call to a data source that is referred in the ALLITEMS function can be established. When the referred data source is SQL queryable, a validation warning occurs in the ER model mapping designer and suggests that using the ALLITEMSQUERY function instead of ALLITEMS is more efficient. The following steps show how this issue may occur.

1.  Start configuring the ER model mapping component.
2.  Add a new data source of the type, **Dynamics 365 for Operations \ Table records**:
    - Name the data source **Vendor**.
    - In the **Table** field, select **VendTable** to specify that this data source will request the **VendTable** table.
3.  Add a new data source of the type **Calculated field** to get records for several vendors:
    - Name the data source **FilteredVendor**.
    - Configure the data source as containing the `FILTER(Vendor, OR(Vendor.AccountNum="US-101",Vendor.AccountNum="US-102"))` expression.
4.  Add a new data source of the *Calculated field* type to get transactions of all filtered vendors:
    1.  Name it as **FilteredVendorTrans**.
    2.  Configure it as containing the `ALLITEMS(FilteredVendor.'<Relations'.'VendTrans.VendTable_AccountNum')` expression.
5.  Select **Validate** to inspect the editable model mapping component on the **Model mapping designer** page.

### Automatic resolution availability

You can select **Fix** to automatically replace the **ALLITEMS** function with **ALLITEMSQUERY** in an expression of every data source that has been encountered in the  **Warning** grid for this kind of inspection.

You can check a single warning in the **Warning** grid and select the **Fix selected** option to automatically change the only expression of a data source that is mentioned in the checked warning.

### Manual resolution

You can manually adjust expressions of all grid data sources mentioned in the validation by replacing the **ALLITEMS** function with **ALLITEMSQUERY**.  

## <a name="i9">Consideration of empty list cases</a>

You can configure your ER format or model mapping component to get the field value of a data source of the type **Record list**. ER checks whether your design considers the case when a called data source contains no records (is empty) to prevent runtime errors when value is fetched from a field of non-existing record. The following steps show how this issue may occur.

1.  Start configuring the ER data model, the ER model mapping, and the ER format components simultaneously.
2.  In the data model tree, add a new **Root3** root item.
3.  Modify the **Root3** item by adding a new nested **Vendor** item of the type **Record list**.
4.  Modify the **Vendor** item:
    - Add a new nested **Name** field of the type, **String**.
    - Add a new nested **AccountNumber** field of the type, **String**.

    ![Configure the ER data model component on the Data model page](./media/er-components-inspections-09a.png)

5.  In the model mapping data sources pane, add a new data source of the type, **Dynamics 365 for Operations \ Table records**:
    - Name the data source **Vendor**.
    - In the **Table** field, select **VendTable** to specify that this data source will request the **VendTable** table.
6.  Add a new data source of the type, **General \ User input parameter** to search for a vendor account on the runtime dialog page:
    - Name the data source **RequestedAccountNum**.
    - In the **Label** field, enter **Vendor account number**.
    - In the **Operations data type name** field, leave **Description**.
7.  Add a new data source of the type **Calculated field** to filter an inquired vendor:
    - Name the data source **FilteredVendor**.
    - Configure it as containing the `FILTER(Vendor, Vendor.AccountNum=RequestedAccountNum)` expression.
8.  Bind the data model items to configured data sources:
    - Bind **FilteredVendor** to **Vendor**
    - Bind **FilteredVendor.AccountNum** to **Vendor.AccountNumber**
    - Bind **FilteredVendor.'name()'** to **Vendor.Name**

    ![Configure the ER model mapping component on the Model mapping designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-09b.png)

9.  In the format structure tree, add the following items to generate an outbound document in XML format that contains the vendor details :
    1.  Add the **Statement** root XML element.
    2.  For the **Statement** XML element, add the nested **Party** XML element.
        1.  For the **Party** XML element, add the nested **Name** XML attribute.
        2.  For the **Party** XML element, add the nested **AccountNum** XML attribute.
10. Bind format elements to provided data sources:
    - Bind the **Statement\Party\Name** format element to the **model.Vendor.Name** data source field
    - Bind the **Statement\Party\AccountNum** format element to the **model.Vendor.AccountNumber** data source field
11. Select **Validate** to inspect the editable format component on the **Format designer** page.

    ![Validate ER format component on the Format designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-09c.png)
    
    >[!NOTE]
    > A validation errors occur that says an error might be thrown for the configured **Statement\Party\Name** and **Statement\Party\AccountNum** format components at runtime when the **model.Vendor** list will be empty.

    ![Validate ER format component on the Format designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-09d.png)

The following illustration shows the runtime error that occurs when you ignore this warning and select **Run** to execute this format selecting the account number of non-existing vendor. As the requested vendor does not exist, the **model.Vendor** list will be empty containing no records:

![Run the editable format on the Format designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-09e.png)

### Automatic resolution availability

For the selected warning row in the **Warnings** grid, you can select the **Unbind** option to automatically remove from the format elements the binding which is pointed in the **Path** column.

### Manual resolution

#### Option 1

You can bind the **Statement\Party\Name** format element to the **model.Vendor** data source item. At runtime, this binding calls the **model.Vendor** data source first. When **model.Vendor** returns the empty record list, the nested format elements are not executed. Therefore, no validation warnings occur for this format configuration.

![Validate ER format component on the Format designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-09e.gif)

#### Option 2

Change the binding of the **Statement\Party\Name** format element from `model.Vendor.Name` to `FIRSTORNULL(model.Vendor).Name`. The updated binding conditionally converts the first record of the **model.Vendor** data source of the type **Record list**, to a new data source of the type **Record** and contains the same set of fields:

- When at least one record is available in the **model.Vendor** data source, the fields of the record are filled in by values of fields of the first record of the **model.Vendor** data source. Therefore, the updated binding returns the vendor name in this case.
- Otherwise, every field of the created record is filled in by a value that is default for the data type of this field. The blank string as the default value of the **String** data type is returned in this case.

Therefore, the validation warning does not occur for the **Statement\Party\Name** format element when it is bound to the `FIRSTORNULL(model.Vendor).Name` expression.

![Validate ER format component on the Format designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-09f.gif)

#### Option 3

Change the binding of the **Statement\Party\Name** format element from `model.Vendor.Name` to `IF(NOT(ISEMPTY(model.Vendor)), model.Vendor.Name, "Not available")` when you want to explicitly specify what data is populated to a generated document when the **model.Vendor** data source of the *Record list* type returns no records (the **Not available** text in this example). The expression `IF(COUNT(model.Vendor)=0, model.Vendor.Name, "Not available")` can be also be used.

### <a name="i9a">Additional consideration</a>

The inspection also warns you about one more potential issue. As you bind **Statement\Party\Name** and **Statement\Party\AccountNum** format elements to the appropriate fields of the **model.Vendor** data source of the *Record list* type, by default these bindings will be executed and take values of the appropriate fields of the first records of the **model.Vendor** data source when this list is not empty. As you have not bound the **Statement\Party** format element with the **model.Vendor** data source, the **Statement\Party** element will not be iterated for every record of the **model.Vendor** data source during the format execution. A generated document will be populated with information only from the first record of the record list if the list contains multiple records. There might be an issue if this format is designed with the intention to populate a generated document with information about all vendors from the **model.Vendor** data source. To resolve this issue, bind the **Statement\Party** element with the **model.Vendor** data source.

## <a name="i10">Executability of an expression containing the FILTER function (caching)</a>

Several built-in ER functions including [FILTER](er-functions-list-filter.md) and [ALLITEMSQUERY](er-functions-list-allitemsquery.md), are used to access application tables, views, or data entities by placing a single SQL call to get required data as the list of records. A data source of the **Record list** type is used as an argument of each of these functions to specify a particular application source for this call. ER checks whether the direct SQL call to a data source that is referred in such function can be established. When the referred data source is not SQL queryable as it was marked as [cached](trace-execution-er-troubleshoot-perf.md#improve-the-model-mapping-based-on-information-from-the-execution-trace), a validation error occurs in the ER model mapping designer. The error states that the ER expression containing one of these functions can't be executed at runtime. The following steps show how this issue may occur.

1.  Start configuring the ER model mapping component.
2.  Add a new data source of the type, **Dynamics 365 for Operations \ Table records**:
    - Name the data source **Vendor**.
    - In the **Table** field, select **VendTable** to specify that this data source will request the **VendTable** table.
3.  Add a new data source of the type **General \ User input parameter** to search for a vendor account on the runtime dialog page:
    - Name the data source **RequestedAccountNum**.
    - In the **Label** field, enter **Vendor account number**.
    - In the **Operations data type name** field, leave **Description**.
4.  Add a new data source of the type **Calculated field** to filter an inquired vendor:
    1.  Name it as **FilteredVendor**.
    2.  Configure it as containing the `FILTER(Vendor, Vendor.AccountNum=RequestedAccountNum)` expression.
5.  Mark the configured **Vendor** data source as cached.

    ![Configure ER model mapping component on the Model mapping designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-10a.gif)

6.  Select **Validate** to inspect the editable model mapping component on the **Model mapping designer** page.

    ![Validate ER model mapping component on the Model mapping designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-10a.png)

    >[!NOTE]
    > A validation error occurs and says that the FILTER function can't be applied to the cached **Vendor** data source.

The following illustration shows the runtime error that occurs when you ignore this warning and select **Run** to execute this format:

![Run the editable format on the Format designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-10b.png)

### Automatic resolution availability

The option to automatically resolve this issue is not offered.

### Manual resolution

#### Option 1

Remove the **Cache** flag from the **Vendor** data source. The **FilteredVendor** data source will become executable, but the **Vendor** data source referred to in the **VendTable** table will be accessed every time the **FilteredVendor** data source is called.

#### Option 2

Modify the expression of the **FilteredVendor** data source from `FILTER(Vendor, Vendor.AccountNum="US-101")` to `WHERE(Vendor, Vendor.AccountNum="US-101")`. In this case, the  **Vendor** data source, referred in the **VendTable** table, will be accessed only during the first call of the **Vendor** data source. Hoever, the selection of records will be performed in memory. This can be a cause of poor performance.

## <a name="i11">Missing binding in a model mapping for a bound format element</a>

When you configure the ER format component, the base ER data model is offered as a default data source for this ER format. When the configured ER format is executed, the [default model mapping](er-country-dependent-model-mapping.md) for the base model is used to fill in the data model with application data. The ER format designer provides a warning when you bind a format element to a data model item that isn't bound to any data source in the model mapping that is currently selected as a default for the editable format. Such binding can't be executed at runtime becuase the running format can't fill in a bound element with application data. Therefore, an error occurs at runtime. The following steps show how this issue may occur.

1.  Start configuring the ER data model, the ER model mapping, and the ER format components simultaneously.
2.  In the data model tree, add a new **Root3** root item.
3.  Modify the **Root3** item by adding a new nested **Vendor** item of the type, **Record list**.
4.  Modify the **Vendor** item:
    - Add a new nested **Name** field of the type, **String**.
    - Add a new nested **AccountNumber** field of the type, **String**.

    ![Configure the ER data model component on the Data model page](./media/er-components-inspections-11a.png)

5.  In the model mapping data sources pane, add a new data source of the type, **Dynamics 365 for Operations \ Table records**:
    - Name the data source **Vendor**.
    - In the **Table** field, select **VendTable** to specify that this data source will request the **VendTable** table.
6.  Add a new data source of the type, **General \ User input parameter** to inquire into a vendor account on runtime dialog page:
    - Name the data source **RequestedAccountNum**.
    - In the **Label** field, enter **Vendor account number**.
    - In the **Operations data type name** field, leave **Description**.
7.  Add a new data source of the type, **Calculated field** to filter an inquired vendor: 
    - Name the data source **FilteredVendor**.
    - Configure the data source as containing the `FILTER(Vendor, Vendor.AccountNum=RequestedAccountNum)` expression.
8.  Bind the data model items to configured data sources:
       - Bind **FilteredVendor** to **Vendor**
       - Bind **FilteredVendor.AccountNum** to **Vendor.AccountNumber**

## <a name="i12">A template is not linked to any file component</a>

When you [manually](er-fillable-excel.md#manual-entry) configure an ER format component to generate an outbound document by using a template, you must manually add the **Excel\File** element, add a required template as an attachment of the editable componen,t and select this attachment in the added **Excel\File** element indicating that this element will fill in the selected template at runtime. When you configure a format component version in the **Draft** [status](general-electronic-reporting.md#component-versioning), you might add several templates to the editable component selecting each of them in the **Excel\File** element to run this ER format and see how different templates are filled in at runtime. When you have some templates that are not selected in any of **Excel\File** elements, the ER format designer warns you that such templates will be deleted from the editable ER format component version when the status of it is changed from **Draft** to **Completed**. The following steps show how this issue may occur.

1.  Start configuring the ER format component.
2.  In the format structure tree, add the **Excel\File** element.
3.  For the added **Excel\File** element, add an Excel workbook file **A.xlsx** as an attachment using the document type configured in [ER parameters](electronic-reporting-er-configure-parameters.md#parameters-to-manage-documents) to specify the storage of ER format templates.
4.  For the added **Excel\File** element, add another Excel workbook file **B.xlsx** as an attachment using the same document type as workbook A.
5.  Select the  Excel workbook file A in the added **Excel\File** element.
6. Select **Validate** to inspect the editable format component on the **Format designer** page.

## <a name="i13">ER format structure is not in sync with the Excel template</a>

When you [configure](er-fillable-excel.md) an ER format component to generate an outbound document by using an Excel template, you can manually add the **Excel\File** element, add a required template as an attachment of the editable component, and select this attachment in the added **Excel\File** element to indicate that this element will fill in the selected template at runtime. As the added template has been designed externally, the editable ER format might contain Excel names that are missing in the added Excel template. The ER format designer provides a warning about inconsistencies between the properties of the ER format elements that refer to names that aren't included in the added Excel template. The following steps show how this issue may occur.

1. Start configuring the ER format component.
2. In the format structure tree, add the **Excel\File** element, **Report**.
3. For the added **Excel\File** element, add the Excel workbook file **A.xlsx** as an attachment. Use the document type configured in [ER parameters](electronic-reporting-er-configure-parameters.md#parameters-to-manage-documents) to specify the storage of ER format templates.
    
    Make sure that the added Excel workbook does not contain the name, **ReportTitle**.
    
4. Add the **Excel\Cell** element **Title** as the nested element of the **Report** element and in the **Excel range** field, enter **ReportTitle**.
5. Select **Validate** to inspect the editable format component on the **Format designer** page.

    ![Validate ER format component on the Format designer page](./media/er-components-inspections-13a.png)

### Automatic resolution availability

The option to automatically resolve this issue is not offered.

### Manual resolution

#### Option 1

Modify the configured format by removing all elements that refer to Excel names that are missing from the template.

#### Option 2

[Update](er-fillable-excel.md#template-import) the editable ER format by importing an Excel template. The structure of the editable ER format will be [synchronized](modify-electronic-reporting-format-reapply-excel-template.md) with the structure of the imported Excel template.

### Additional consideration

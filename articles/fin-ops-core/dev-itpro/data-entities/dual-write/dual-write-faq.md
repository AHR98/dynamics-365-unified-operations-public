# Dual-write frequently asked questions

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

We've compiled a list of frequently asked questions and provided brief answers to help you get to your information quickly.

## Setup
### Is dual write available for Government Community Cloud (GCC)?
Not yet. 
Dual write requires Finance and Operations apps environment and CDS environment to be in the same tenant. Since Finance and Operations apps is not available in GCC yet, dual write doesnâ€™t support linking Finance and Operations apps/CDS across two different tenants.
### If a customer doesn't have sales or field service, but they just want to have the sales order data in CDS, can they do it without buying sales/CE license?
When customers possess a valid Finance and Operations applications license, they are entitled to enable dual write between the Common Data Service and Finance and Operations applications. This entitlement does not include capacity consumed by the replicated data; if necessary, this is purchased separately. This entitlement does not include use rights for the Dynamics 365 for Customer Engagement applications, including Sales, Service, Marketing, etc; if necessary, this is purchased separately.
### Any plans to let DW use CDS as a hub between multiple F&O instances, allowing for data to synchronize between two or  more F&O instances?
The current plan of record is to restrict this to 1-1 mapping between F&O and CDS.
### Can you control the sequencing of maps in Dual write, like in DI?
DW is transaction based. For example, if one change in F&O happens to trigger multiple maps to sync with CDS, then these will be in sequenced by default as they are updated in the database.  
This makes more sense in the context of initial sync; system will provide related entity map in a specified order and you can reorder the list to best suit to your environment.
### Do the application users need to have any special permissions to enable/configure dual write ?
Dual write setup requires 2 Azure AD applications setups in Finance &Operations and relevant application users to be setup in CDS. These application users should contain the appropriate application IDs, see [documentation link](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/data-entities/dual-write/requirements-and-prerequisites#verify-requirements-and-grant-access) for more details, and they need to be given relevant entity permissions via a security role for the connection to work properly.

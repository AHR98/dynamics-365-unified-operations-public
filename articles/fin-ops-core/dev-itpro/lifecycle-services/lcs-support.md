<ul>
<li>On the <strong>Active issue</strong> tab, select your issue, and then click <strong>Submit to Microsoft</strong>.</li>
<li>On the <strong>Submitted to Microsoft</strong> tab, click <strong>Submit an incident</strong> and follow the instructions to submit the incident. After you submit the incident, you will receive an email message from the Microsoft Support engineer assigned to your case.</li>

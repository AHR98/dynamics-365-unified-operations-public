# Service Description for Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## Overview

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Operations is an Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) SaaS that is built on and for the Microsoft Azure Cloud. The service provides organizations with the ERP functionality to support their unique requirements and help them adjust to constantly changing business environments, without managing infrastructure. Finance and Operations can include one or more of the following solution areas: 

- [Finance](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/finance/)
- [Human Resources](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/human-resources/)
- [Supply Chain Management](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/supply-chain/)
- [Commerce](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/commerce/)
- [Project Operations](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/project-operations/)

The SaaS brings together these applications, plus business intelligence, infrastructure, compute, and database services, and enables organizations to run industry-specific and operational business processes. With the support of their Implementation Partner, Customers determine the configuration of the business application logic in Finance and Operations to match their unique business processes. Functionality and Business Processes can be augmented or extended with one or any combination of the following:

- Low-Code [Microsoft Power Platform](https://powerplatform.microsoft.com) Tools
- Pro Developer [Microsoft Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) and [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com)
- Independent Software Vendor (ISV) solutions from [Microsoft AppSource](https://appsource.microsoft.com/partners)

Based on requirements, Customers choose their solution approach. Working with their Implementation Partner, Customers define, develop, and test their solution using the tools and best practices that are provided in [Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/lcs). The following illustrates three common scenarios: 

![Common configuration scenarios](media/common-configuration-scenarios.png)

-	**Solution 1:** Standard Finance and Operations configuration (no extension) 
-	**Solution 2:** Finance and Operations configuration with customer-specific extensions 
-	**Solution 3:** Finance and Operations configuration with customer-specific extensions and one or more ISV solution  

Organizations can match their business growth by easily adding users and business processes with a simple, transparent subscription model. Refer to the [Dynamics 365 Licensing Guide](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/docs/view/Microsoft-Dynamics-365) for more details.


## Operating model

The operating model of Finance and Operations defines specific roles and responsibilities for the Customer, Implementation Partner, and Microsoft throughout the lifecycle of the service. 

Microsoft manages the Finance and Operations service by deploying, actively monitoring, and servicing customer sandbox and production environments within the Microsoft SaaS subscription. This includes allocating the required system infrastructure to run the service and proactive communication to customers about the service’s health. 

![Implementation roles and responsibilities](media/FO-Operating-Model.PNG)

For more information, see [Cloud Operations and Servicing](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/cloud-operations-servicing)

## System configuration

Finance and Operations scales with transaction volume and user load. Each Customer implementation of Finance and Operations produces a unique solution comprised of the following: 

-	**Data composition:** A unique set of parameters that control behavior, layout of the organization, structure of master data (such as financial and inventory dimensions), and granularity of transaction tracking. 
-	**Extension and configuration:** Extension mechanisms of Finance and Operations with code extensions, ISV solutions, and unique configurations including workflows, integrations, and report configurations. 
-	**Usage patterns:** A unique combination of online and batch usage combined with the ability to integrate with upstream and downstream systems for unified data flow and the ability to differentiate based on the information views used by customers in their business processes. 

Microsoft configures customer production environments that are sized to handle the transaction volumes and user concurrency. Microsoft is responsible for: 

-	Proper allocation of resources of production environments, based on the Customer’s profiling information in the [LCS Subscription Estimator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/subscription-estimator); 
-	Continually monitoring and diagnosing service availability of production environments; and 
-	Analyzing and troubleshooting system performance issues with Finance and Operations. 

To ensure that an implementation is configured for high performance, customers must:

-	Provide accurate usage information for the Finance and Operations implementation in the [LCS Subscription Estimator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/subscription-estimator) 
- Build and test extensions for performance and scale 
-	Test data configurations appropriately for performance 

## Service operations

Service operations reflect various aspects of provisioning and use of Finance and Operations, from onboarding and implementation to updates and monitoring. For each successful implementation of Finance and Operations, Microsoft, the customer, and implementation partner or ISV (when applicable) have specific roles and responsibilities.

### Data back-up and retention 

Databases for Microsoft-managed environments are protected by automatic back-ups. Automatic back-ups are retained for 28 days for production environments (unless Microsoft performs a rollback) and 7 days for sandbox (Tier 2+) environments. A rollback of production may be performed in the event a failure occurs during any planned maintenance update specified in [planned maintenance responsibilities](service-description.md#planned-maintenance-responsibilities).

For more information about automatic back-ups, see [Automated backups - Azure SQL Database & SQL Managed Instance](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/azure-sql/database/automated-backups-overview?tabs=single-database).

### Service update strategy and maintenance windows 

Customers must stay current on the latest service updates in accordance with the [software lifecycle policy](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/versions-update-policy). Finance and Operations follows the Microsoft Modern Lifecycle Policy, which covers products that are serviced and supported continuously. The following illustrates the process:
 
![Common configuration scenarios](media/FO-OneVersion.png)

For more details refer to [One Version Service updates](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamics365/unified-operations/dev-itpro/lifecycle-services/oneversion-overview).

Service Updates are released as a single cumulative update, known as a deployable package, for customers to uptake. Microsoft notifies the customer when a new service update is made available. Microsoft updates customer environments to the latest released update within the maintenance window configured in the customer's LCS project. Unless the service update is paused, the environment will be updated to the latest release. Customers have the option to take the update outside of the scheduled maintenance window via self-service update. We recommend customers stay current for a better service experience.

Please note that some service updates may be mandatory and require no consent. To help protect our customers and the service, Microsoft may apply critical security updates directly to a customer's Finance and Operations production environment.

#### Planned maintenance responsibilities 

Microsoft provides customers with the types of updates to Finance and Supply Chain Management environments set forth in the table below. These updates may require downtime on production environments. The downtime window can be categorized as *Microsoft planned maintenance* (initiated by Microsoft) or *customer planned maintenance* (initiated by the customer). Updates are initiated or scheduled by the customer via LCS.

The responsibilities of Microsoft, the implementation partner, and the customer are reflected in the table below for each update type.

| Type of update | Expected action from Microsoft | Expected action from customer/implementation partner | Maintenance window<br><br>*(Microsoft's estimated maintenance downtime)*|
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|------|
| **Service updates**</br>*Service updates are collections of quality updates and new features for the application and the platform, provided as a deployable package. They are backward compatible* | Initiate updates to the application within the configured maintenance window. | Customer must always stay current on the latest version of the application. | Microsoft initiated maintenance window<br>*(30 minutes – 4 hours*)*|
| **Critical update**</br>*Update that solves a critical issue.* | <ul><li>Notify customer of the critical update.</br><br><li>Initiate update within the specified timeline. | Apply the critical update.| Microsoft initiated maintenance window<br>*(30 minutes – 4 hours)* |
| **Extensions**</br>*Change to the standard business application logic.* | No action required. | Validate extensions in customer's non-production instances then promote them to customer's production instance.| Customer initiated maintenance window</br>*(1 – 4 hours)* |
| **Infrastructure updates**<br>*Infrastructure updates are updates made to the underlying infrastructure like operating system updates. These are done monthly.* | Initiate updates within the Microsoft planned maintenance window. | No action needed. | Microsoft initiated maintenance window</br>*(1 – 4 hours)*  |
| **Finance and Operations**</br>*IP address whitelisting - Securing access from customer's corpnet to Finance and Supply Chain Management.* | Finance and Supply Chain Management are Azure services and use Azure IP address ranges. | Customers need to whitelist the Azure datacenter ranges for both their primary and Geo-DR datacenters.</br><br>Link to doc for IP address ranges for Azure. | N/A |
| **Security**</br>*Secure Infrastructure.* | Microsoft installs anti-malware, uses SSL, rotate secrets, and adheres strictly to SOC/ISO standards.|Refer to the [Microsoft Trust Center](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/security/dynamics365-security)or more details on security. | N/A |
| **ExpressRoute**</br>*Dedicated connection to Finance and Operations.*| Finance and Operations enabled ExpressRoute over public peering. | Customers must work with their Azure ExpressRoute service provider to acquire a dedicated connection to Finance and Operations. | N/A |

\*\*Promoting an update to a customer's production environment is a service request to Microsoft that must be initiated from LCS. This is within the customer planned maintenance window. Request is planned to be executed within two business days. Generally, 95% of updates are applied in less than an hour.

#### Microsoft planned maintenance schedule and communication 

Scheduled downtime means periods of downtime related to network, hardware, or service maintenance or updates. Microsoft will publish notice or notify Customers at least **five days** prior to the commencement of such downtime. The default downtime window as listed below are scheduled on weekends in time windows defined per region to minimize the impact to the customers' business.

Microsoft's planned maintenance schedule:

- **NAM:** 2 AM to 10 AM
- **EMEA:** 10 PM to 6 AM
- **APAC:** 12 PM to 9 PM

### Security and administrative access 

Administrative access to a Finance and Operations production environment is strictly controlled and logged. Customer data is handled in accordance with the Microsoft Online Services Terms. Customer's tenant administrator can access production instances or non-production instances as described in the following table.

For more information, see [Licensing terms and documentation](https://www.microsoft.com/licensing/product-licensing/products).

#### Customer's administrative access

| Environment type | Purpose  | Level of customer access  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Non-production instance**</br>Sandbox Tier 1: Developer instance | A non-production instance that the customer can use for development or to customize any service and unit tests that the customer changes. | A Tier 1 sandbox is deployed as a VM to a customer's own Azure subscription via LCS. Because it is a VM in the customer's own Azure subscription, the customer has full administrator access to development environment. Customer will continue to have full administrative access to the SQL Server installed in the environment. These environments are fully managed by the customer and available to deploy via Cloud Hosted Environments. |
| **Non-production instance**</br>Sandbox Tier 2: Standard Acceptance Testing instance (or any sandbox Tier add-on)| Non-production instance that customer can use for user acceptance testing, integration testing, and training of any service. | Customer will not have remote desktop access or access to the SQL Server associated with the non-production instance. Customer can connect as an administrator to the database.  These environments are managed by Microsoft. |
| **Production instance** | Use to go-live with any service. | All access is only through the Finance and Supply Chain Management browser client, service endpoints, or through LCS. These environments are managed by Microsoft.|

#### Microsoft's administrator access

The following table details the different levels of access for different Microsoft administrators.

| Administrator | Customer data  |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Operations responses team<br>(Limited to key personnel only) |Yes, granted by support ticket. Access is audited and limited to the duration of the support activity. |
| Microsoft Customer Support Services | No direct access. Customer may use screen sharing to work with support staff to debug issues. |
| Engineering | No direct access. Operations response team may use screen sharing to work with engineering to debug issues. |
| Others in Microsoft | No access.|

### Monitoring and incident management 

#### Monitoring 

Microsoft has invested in an extensive toolset to monitor and diagnose Customers' production instances. Microsoft monitors Customers' production environments 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. Customer must monitor its production instances for application configurations and application errors as described in the following table.

| Microsoft's responsibilities | Customer's responsibilities |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
|<ul><li>Availability monitoring of the service. <br><li>Continuous monitoring and alerts through health metrics and watchdogs for critical components such as AOS, Batch, DIXF, Commerce, and Management Reporter. </br><li>Monitoring for performance degradation caused by infrastructure services (AAD, Azure SQL, etc.). </br><li>In the event Microsoft determines that a single process or batch job is causing aberrations, these processes will be thwarted after communication with the customer.|<ul><li>Monitor changes to application configurations and extensions that can cause functional and performance issues. </br><li>Application errors need to be diagnosed using the monitoring tools. Diagnose user reported performance aberrations using these tools.</br><li>Inform Microsoft in the event that there is expected load on the system beyond projected peak usage.</br><li>In the event the applicable service is unavailable in the production instance, the customer can create a "Production down" customer support request using LCS. |

#### Incident management 

Microsoft responds to and resolves incidents based on the severity levels set forth in the following tables. Microsoft's incident severity levels can be changed during initial assessment of the incident and as more information about the impact and scope becomes available. If the incident is mitigated, then the incident severity remains unchanged.

##### Severity level description

| Classification | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| **Severity 0 (Sev-0)**</br>Catastrophic | <ul><li>Catastrophic event in which all functions of a service in a region are down or inaccessible.</br><br>**Note:** Sev-0 incidents normally start as Sev-1, then get upgraded with management approval based on assessment of impact type/scope. |
| **Severity 1 (Sev-1)**</br>Critical | <ul><li>Severe outage of a service caused by confirmed systemic problem, resulting in a broad scope of impact, requiring a Technical Control Bridge and engagement from applicable engineering teams.</li></br><li>Suspected breach of a security or privacy boundary. |
|**Severity 2 (Sev-2)**</br>Urgent| <ul><li>Service outage with narrow scope of impact (&gt; 25% customers).</br><li>Degradation of customer experience caused by confirmed systemic event with broad scope (&gt; 25% customers).</br><li>Service outage with limited scope of impact (single organization or subset of users). |
|**Severity 3 (Sev-3)**<br>Moderate | <ul><li> Degradation of customer experience caused by confirmed systemic event with narrow scope. |
|**Severity 4 (Sev-4)**<br>Non-SLA impacting | <ul><li>Monitoring or customer-reported incidents requiring action to avoid potential service impact.</br><li>General maintenance events with no customer impact.</br><li>Standard service change requests.|

##### Incident scope and severity level impact

| Incident impact | Entire geo <br>-OR- <br>less than 25% of global footprint | One customer <br>-OR- <br>subset of users belonging to one customer |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Service is unavailable | Sev-1 | Sev-2 |
| Service is usable only through a workaround or critical subset feature is malfunctioning | Sev-2 | Sev-3 |
| Degradation of performance, or non critical subset feature is malfunctioning | Sev-3 | Sev-4 |
| Incidents requiring action to avoid potential impact or service disruption | Sev-3 | Sev-4 |

### Business continuity with high availability and disaster recovery 

Microsoft provides business continuity and disaster recovery for production instances of Finance and Operations if a Microsoft Azure region-wide outage occurs. See [Business continuity and disaster recovery](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/sysadmin/business-continuity-disaster-recovery) for more details.

- **High Availability**: HA functionality provides ways to prevent downtime caused by the failure of a single node within an Azure datacenter. Each service's cloud architecture uses Azure availability sets for the compute tier to prevent single-point-of-failure events. HA for databases is provided through Azure SQL (a platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering from Microsoft).

- **Disaster Recovery**: DR features protect each service against outages broadly impacting an entire Azure datacenter and include the following:
  - Azure SQL active-geo replication for primary database (business database), with a Recovery Point Objective (RPO) estimate of ≤ 5 seconds.
  - Geo-redundant copies of Azure blob storage (containing document attachments) in other Azure regions.
  - Same secondary region for the Azure SQL and Azure blob storage replications.

The primary data stores are supported for replication. This means that components for each service, such Management Reporter and entity store, use transformed data from the primary database, which need to be generated after the recovery site has been setup and service started. Customer code artifacts and recovered data stores are used to re-deploy the site, with a Recovery Time Objective (RTO) of up to 10 hours. This will enable state replication of the compute nodes along with networking and other components to set up the secondary site using the recovered data stores. In the event DR is utilized to recover the customer's production instance, Microsoft and customer will perform the responsibilities in [Incident management](service-description.md#incident-management).


| Microsoft's responsibilities  | Customer's responsibilities |
|-------------------------|-------------------------|
| Microsoft provisions a secondary environment in the Azure paired datacenter at the time of deployment of the primary production instance.</br><br>See the [Business continuity and disaster recovery (BCDR): Azure Paired Regions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/best-practices-availability-paired-regions) for details. | None |
| Microsoft enables Geo Redundancy of SQL and Azure Storage at the time of deployment of the primary production instance. | None|
| Microsoft enables automatic backup on the Azure SQL databases. |None |
| On outage, Microsoft determines if a failover needs to be executed for the customer and if there will be a data loss. Data loss can be up to 5 sec. For details, see [Azure SQL Database Geo-Restore]https://azure.microsoft.com/blog/azure-sql-database-geo-restore). <br>In the event of a data loss, Microsoft will send a request to the customer asking for its sign-off on a failover. | Customer may need to provide written sign-off to trigger the failover in the event of data loss.|
| The applicable Service will be operated in limited mode on failover. Update maintenance cannot be triggered in failover mode. | Customer cannot request package deployments or other regular maintenance requests in failover mode. |
| Microsoft fails back to the production instance in the primary Azure region when the datacenter becomes operational. Normal operations are resumed. | Customer may need to sign-off on fail back to the production instance in the primary Azure region.|


### Application support offerings 

Microsoft offers VL customers three support plans: Premier, Professional Direct, and the support included in the subscription. The level of support differs per plan and highlights are provided in the following table.

| Service feature | Premier | Professional direct  | Subscription |
|-----------------|-------------|-----------------|--------------|
| Unlimited break/fix incidents | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| 24x7 support | N/A | N/A | Local business hours |
| Fastest response times | &lt;1 hour | &lt;1 hour | Next business day |
| Advisory hours | Pools acquired per agreement | N/A | N/A |
| Dedicated Support Account Manager | Yes | N/A | N/A |

#### Process to engage support

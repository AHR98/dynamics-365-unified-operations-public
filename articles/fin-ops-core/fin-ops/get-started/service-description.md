## Overview

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Finance and Supply Chain Management is a cloud Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) service for enterprises, built on and for Microsoft Azure. It provides organizations with ERP functionality that supports their unique requirements and helps them adjust to constantly changing business environments, without the hassle of managing infrastructure. Finance and Supply Chain Management brings together a set of ERP, business intelligence, infrastructure, compute, and database services in a single offering that enables organizations to run industry-specific and operational business processes that are extendable with specific solutions from Independent Software Vendors (ISV) (see Microsoft AppSource). Organizations can match their business growth by easily adding users and business processes with a simple, transparent subscription model.

## Operating model

The operating model of Finance and Supply Chain Management distinguishes specific roles and responsibilities for Customer, Implementation Partner, and Microsoft throughout the lifecycle of the service. 

Microsoft maintains the Finance and Supply Chain Management service by deploying, actively monitoring, and servicing the Customer’s production tenants.  This includes allocating the required system infrastructure to run the service and proactive communication to Customers about the service’s health.

With the support of their Implementation Partner, Customers determine the configuration of the business application logic in Finance and Supply Chain Management to match their unique business processes. Customers can extend Finance and Supply Chain Management with ISV solutions of their choice, unique customizations, or a combination of these. Customers typically choose one of the following configuration scenarios: 

-	**Solution 1:** Standard Finance and Supply Chain Management configuration (no extension) 
-	**Solution 2:** Finance and Supply Chain Management configuration with Customer-specific extensions 
-	**Solution 3:** Finance and Supply Chain Management configuration with one or more ISV solutions and Customer-specific extensions 

For any of these scenarios, the Customer defines, develops, and tests any modifications using Microsoft Dynamics Lifecycle Services (LCS) and tools.

# Debugging best practices for Dynamics 365 Commerce development 

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes some best practices to follow when debugging Dynamics 365 Commerce customizations. 

The Dynamics 365 Commerce platform provides a rich online software development kit (SDK) for developer extensibility. Custom modules, data actions, and themes can be created, or modules from the Commerce [module library](../starter-kit-overview.md) can be extended. It is important to consider web site performance when building Commerce customizations. Standard best practices used for website development are applicable including minimizing HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files, and optimizing images.

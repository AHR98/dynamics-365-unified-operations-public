# Modules overview

This topic provides an overview of .

## Modules

Modules represent the core building blocks that make up an online e-Commerce page. Here are some examples of modules:

* A content block module that is featured on a page, and that shows a product image and description, together with a "call-to-action" button that can be used to purchase the product or get more information about it
* A promo banner module that highlights a promotion as a banner on a page
* A header module that is made up of smaller module components, such as a search module, a sign-in module, and a navigation module
* A script module that injects JavaScript onto page

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce provides a **store starter kit** set of modules to use when building your pages.  See [Starter kit overview](..\starter-kit-overview.md) document for more details.  

To see how a site builder page builder interacts with modules see the [Work with modules](..\work-with-modules.md) document.

## Get started with module development
The store starter kit provides a broad set of modules for use on your online site, however you may have requirements that will require some module customization.

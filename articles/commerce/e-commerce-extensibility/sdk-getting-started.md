# Getting started with e-Commerce online SDK development

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides an overview of how to get started developing e-Commerce customizations with the Dynamics 365 Commerce online SDK.

## Overview
Below, you will find all the details to get started with e-Commerce extensibility development. The Commerce **online SDK** allows development and debugging of e-Commerce [modules](modules-overview.md), [data actions](data-actions.md) and [themes](theming.md).  The SDK can be installed and used on any Windows 10 environment without the need for a deployed Commerce environment, however it can also be useful to connect to a live cloud environment ("Dev", "Test", "UAT" or "Prod") for deeper debugging and testing changes against a cloud environment without the need to deploy or destabilize the environment.

The typical process when extending the e-Commerce platform includes the following:
* Install the necessary development tools
* Install the latest online SDK
* Optionally set up an Azure DevOps build pipeline for code sharing and build management
* Build and extend modules, data actions and themes as needed
* Test modules/data actions and themes using mock data
* Optionally test modifications against a cloud environment
* Build an e-Commerce configuration package of all changes
* Deploy configuration package to a cloud environment

## Architectural Overview
Before starting e-Commerce extensibilty development it would be good to have an understanding of the architecture.  The [Dynamics 365 Commerce architecture overview](../commerce-architecture.md) and [e-Commerce architectural overview](architectural-overview.md) topics are great places to get started.  The [e-Commerce component](ecommerce-components.md) topic will also provide an overview of the main extensibile e-Commerce components including modules, data actions and themes.


## Setting up a local online SDK development environment

### Development system requirements
Before setting up a development environment ensure that your environment meets the minimum requirements as noted in the [system requirements for a Dynamics 365 Commerce online extensibility environment](system-requirements.md) topic.

### Install development tools and online SDK
E-Commerce development leverages some free open sources tools including **Node.js** for the JavaScript runtime, **Yarn** for dependency management and **Visual Studio Code** for a source editor.  Detailed steps to install each tool followed by the online SDK can be found in the [set up a development environment](setup-dev-environment.md) topic.  This topic will also cover how to run a Node app to test/preview modules under development as well as cover the [CLI tools](cli-command-reference.md) used to create and clone a module.

## Developing against a cloud hosted Commerce environment
The e-Commerce online SDK allows development and debugging of modules, data actions and themes without the need for a deployed Commerce environment, which is the default behavior if you followed the above section to set up a development environment. There may be scenarios where you need to debug your live e-Commerce web site or test configuration changes against a live [cloud environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dynamics365/fin-ops-core/dev-itpro/migration-upgrade/update-guide?toc=/dynamics365/commerce/toc.json#environments) including a "Dev", "Test", "UAT" or "Prod" environment.  This section will cover how to configure your development environment against a cloud hosted Commerce environment

### SDK environment .env file
The online SDK includes a **.env** file in the root folder which has several environment variables to configure your development environment against a cloud environment.  Details for each variable can be found in the [Configure a development (.env) file](configure-env-file.md) topic.  

### Configure against a cloud enviroment
The following topic [debug against a tier 1 Commerce development environment](debug-tier-1) provides the details on how to configure the .env file to point to a cloud environment.  It will guide you in getting the correct URLs to set for each variable in the .env file.  There are two main scenarios you can setup, the first is to point to a cloud retail server and the second to point the cloud e-Commerce site.

#### Configure against a cloud Retail server
A development environment can be configured to point to a cloud hosted Retail server to allow for debugging modules and data actions against live data.  When the server is configured, all data action calls will go directly to that server, passing back real data to your development environment.  This is a great way to see how a module will render.  Without this set, you will need to use mock data to render your modules, see the [test modules with mock data](test-module-mock.md) and [test data action with mocks](test-data-action-mocks.md) topics for more information.

The .env file contains a variable **"MsDyn365Commerce_BASEURL"** which needs to point to a cloud based Retail server URL. You will also need to point to a specific channel and channel OUN(operating unit number).

The below example shows an example .env file set to point to a specific Retail server, channel and OUN.  Note the catalog ID (MSDyn365Commerce_CATALOGID) must always be 0 since e-Commerce does not support multiple catalogs.

json
```
...
MSDyn365Commerce_BASEURL=https://e-comdevtestf1d01de665c744a7devret.cloud.retail.dynamics.com/
MSDyn365Commerce_CHANNELID=68719478279
MSDyn365Commerce_CATALOGID=0
MSDyn365Commerce_OUN=128
...
```

#### Configure against a cloud hosted e-Commerce site
A development environment can be further configured to point to a cloud hosted e-Commerce site to allow the e-Commerce pages created in the site builder tool to be rendered in the local environment under the local Node.js JavaScript server.  This is useful when testing out changes to modules, data actions and themes against live pages without affecting the live site.  For example you could test out module view changes you have locally for any e-Commerce page, but customers hitting the live site would not see the changes nor will it impact the live e-Commerce site.

E-Commerce site pages are stored in a CMS system as JSON files which can be saved and used for mock files, see the [test modules by using page mocks](test-page-mock.md) topic for more info including how to create a page mock from a live page using the "?item=nodeserviceproxy:true" query string parameter.  These json files contain the break down of modules and their configuration values used to render the page.  The local development environment will do the rendering with local modules in this scenario, allowing for fast testing and iterating of your changes.

Details can be found in the [debug against a tier 1 Commerce development environment](debug-tier-1) topic to setup the **"MSDyn365_HOST"** variable to point to your e-Commerce  environment, which can be seen in the below example:

```json
MSDyn365_HOST=www.fabrikam.com
MSDyn365Commerce_BASEURL=https://e-comdevtestf1d01de665c744a7devret.cloud.retail.dynamics.com/
MSDyn365Commerce_CHANNELID=68719478279
MSDyn365Commerce_CATALOGID=0
MSDyn365Commerce_OUN=128
â€¦
```

## Changing modules, data actions and themes
Once an online SDK environment is set up, you are ready to build custom [modules](create-new-module.md), [data actions](data-actions.md) and [themes](create-theme.md).

## Package creation and deployment
Once you are complete with all your changes, you can follow the instructions on the [Package configurations and deploy them to an online environment](package-deploy.md) topic to build a zip file package and upload it on the LCS site.  You should then see all your changes in the cloud hosted environment it was deployed to.

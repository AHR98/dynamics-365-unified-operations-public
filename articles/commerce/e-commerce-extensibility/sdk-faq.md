This topic summarizes answers to questions frequently asked by users of the Dynamics 365 Commerce online software development kit (SDK).

### TSLint has been deprecated in online SDK version 1.28 (Commerce version 10.0.18 release)
Due to the open source TSLint static analysis tool being deprecated, the Dynamics 365 Commerce online SDK is changing to leverage the [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) static alaysis tool as a replacement.  TSLint will continue to work until SDK version 1.30 (Commerce version 10.0.20 release).  You can manually update to ESLint prior to SDK release 1.30 if desired, but it will be required with release 1.30.  After updating to SDK version 1.28, running ```yarn``` will show a deprecation warning.  You can switch to ESLint at any time after this, but it may cause new errors and warnings to be displayed on your custom code. If you retrieved the online SDK from GitHub with the Commerce 10.0.20 preview release, then it will contain the necessary changes to ESLint and no changes will be needed.  Otherwise if you are updating from an older version of the SDK, you will need to manually update to ESLint before SDK release 1.30.  Follow the section below to manually update from TSLint to ESLint

#### Replacing TSLint with ESLint
Once you have [updated to SDK 1.28](sdk-updates.md) or later, you will need to create a ESLint file and change your packages.json file to include the ESLint dependencies and updated commands to use ESLint.  You can leave the TSLint dependency in the packages.json file if you would like to use both.  Once you update to ESLint, you may see new warnings against your code that can be fixed or ignored if needed.

##### .eslintrc.js file
You will need to add a new file **.eslintrc.js** to your root SDK folder (you should also notice an existing tslint.json file in this directory). This file will contain a base rule set which can be extended
 
The base config contains a set of core rules that is relaxed when it comes to linting restrictions. You may also choose to define your own ruleset or extend another ruleset.
To use the provided base set of rules, create the **.eslintrc.js** file and copy and paste the following code:
 
```javascript
module.exports = {
    extends: '@msdyn365-commerce/eslint-config,
    ignorePatterns: ['.eslintrc.js', '*.html', 'src/__mocks__/**', 'src/__tests__/**'],
    parserOptions: {
        project: ['tsconfig.json'],
        sourceType: 'module',
        ecmaFeatures: {
            jsx: true // Allows for the parsing of JSX
        },
        tsconfigRootDir: __dirname
    }
};
```
 
Additional files/directories that you don't want lint rules applied to can be added to the **ignorePatterns** section.
In addition, you can extend rules or replace rules by defining the rules in the .eslintrc.js file.
 
For example, if you wanted to extend the base config to turn off the header/header rule (requires a header on all files) you would use the following config:
 
```javascript
module.exports = {
    extends: '@msdyn365-commerce/eslint-config',
    ignorePatterns: ['.eslintrc.js', '*.html', 'src/__mocks__/**', 'src/__tests__/**'],
    parserOptions: {
        project: ['tsconfig.json'],
        sourceType: 'module',
        ecmaFeatures: {
            jsx: true // Allows for the parsing of JSX
        },
        tsconfigRootDir: __dirname
    },
    rules: {
        'header/header': 'off'
    }
};
```
You may also optionally wish to override or declare new rules for certain types of files. To accomplish this, use the overrides property as shown below:

```javascript
    overrides: [
        {
            files: ['*.props.autogenerated.ts', '*.data.ts'],
            rules: {
                'header/header': 'off'
            }
        },
        {
            files: ['*.tsx', '*.view.tsx', '*.test.ts'],
            rules: {
                'max-len': 'off',
                'max-lines': 'off'
            }
        }
    ],
```

For more information and other help please consult ESLint documentation.

##### package.json file changes
 
Inside your package.json you can leave the TSLint dependency (if you want to use both) and add the following dependencies into your **devDependencies** section:
 
 ```json
        "@msdyn365-commerce/eslint-config": "^1.27.7",
        "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin": "^4.2.0",
        "@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin-tslint": "^4.10.0",
        "@typescript-eslint/parser": "^4.10.0",
        "eslint": "^7.16.0",
        "eslint-config-prettier": "^7.0.0",
        "eslint-plugin-header": "^3.1.0",
        "eslint-plugin-import": "^2.22.1",
        "eslint-plugin-jsdoc": "^30.7.8",
        "eslint-plugin-no-null": "^1.0.2",
        "eslint-plugin-prettier": "^3.3.0",
        "eslint-plugin-react": "^7.21.5",
 ```
 
Change the lint and lint:fix commands to:
```json
        "lint": "yarn eslint src/**/*.{ts,tsx}",
        "lint:fix": "yarn eslint src/**/*.{ts,tsx} --fix"
```
 
Change the build/start commands to for partner packages
```json 
        "start": "yarn msdyn365b start local --use-eslint",
        "build": "yarn msdyn365b build --use-eslint",
```
 
#### Fixing ESLint Errors
It is optional but recommended to install the ESLint extension for Visual Studio Code. This will help identify errors and warnings directly in your editor and will allow you to use quick actions to ignore linting errors with comments.
 
Run ```yarn lint```
 
You may see new ESLint errors, this is because all the TSLint errors that were suppressed with TSLint comments are popping back up. Fix or disable the ESLint errors. You may choose to ignore the warnings.

If you use the –use-eslint flags to build, the build will fail on errors but will ignore warnings.

#### Disabling Linting In Code

Fix all the errors by replacing tslint disable comments with the new eslint disable comment. You may use file find & replace if that is easier but be sure to verify the results.

Helpful tips:
*You can disable ESLint warnings similar to TSLint by using comments
*To disable next line use // eslint-disable-next-line <rule1>, <rule2>…
*To add a comment about why you are disabling a rule you must add ‘--' e.g. // eslint-disable-next-line <rule1> -- Disabling this rule for reasons
*To disable a rule for an entire file you must use multiline comment e.g. /* eslint-disable <rule1>, <rule2> */ 

Common TSlint-ESlint equivalents
TSLint Rule	ESLint Rule
// tslint:disable-next-line:no-any	// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any
// tslint:disable:no-any	/* eslint-disable @typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any */
// tslint:disable-next-line:cyclomatic-complexity	// eslint-disable-next-line complexity
// tslint:disable-next-line:no-empty	// eslint-disable-next-line no-empty

#### Disabling Linting For a Module

If you wish to disable linting check for the entire module build (build-package) you may use the –disable-linter flag to skip the lint check step. (e.g yarn build-package –disable-linter).


### After upgrading to module library version 9.27 (Commerce version 10.0.17 release), buy box module view extensions might generate a compilation error.

The compilation error is caused by code sharing that is related to the product quick view module that was introduced in the Commerce version 10.0.17 release. Because the quick view module shares lots of functionality with the buy box module, some common components were moved to a common folder, so that the buy box and quick view modules can share the code.

To fix the compilation error, update any import references in the buybox.tsx view file, as shown in the examples that follow.

This example shows the old code for imports in buybox.view.tsx.

```typescript
import { IBuyboxViewProps } from '../..';
import {
    IBuyboxAddToCartViewProps,
    IBuyboxAddToOrderTemplateViewProps,
    IBuyboxAddToWishlistViewProps,
    IBuyboxFindInStoreViewProps,
    IBuyboxKeyInPriceViewProps,
    IBuyboxProductConfigureDropdownViewProps,
    IBuyboxProductConfigureViewProps,
    IBuyboxProductQuantityViewProps,
    IBuyboxShopSimilarLookViewProps
} from './components';
```

This example shows the new code for imports in buybox.view.tsx.

```typescript
import { IBuyboxAddToCartViewProps, IBuyboxAddToOrderTemplateViewProps, IBuyboxAddToWishlistViewProps, IBuyboxKeyInPriceViewProps, IBuyboxProductConfigureDropdownViewProps, IBuyboxProductConfigureViewProps, IBuyboxProductQuantityViewProps, IBuyboxShopSimilarLookViewProps } from '../../common';
import { IBuyboxViewProps } from './buybox';
import { IBuyboxFindInStoreViewProps } from './components/buybox-find-in-store';
```

### After upgrading to module library version 9.24 (10.0.14 release), cloned modules that use data actions may display the error, "UserAuthorizationException. Customer account number on the request was wrong".

The following list of [core data actions](core-data-actions.md) have a signature change that moves the user account number parameter to the second parameter (instead of the first) and is now set as an optional parameter. In most scenarios where the user account number is no longer needed, the data action will execute in the context of the current signed-in user. In some custom scenarios where the user account number is different than the user account number of the signed-in user, you can fetch the user account number by using the **get-customer** data action and passing it to the data action.

Core data actions with signature changes include:
 
- **add-address**
- **get-address**
- **get-customer**
- **get-loyalty-card**
- **get-loyalty-transaction-estimation**
- **issue-loyalty**

The module library modules have been updated with the correct calling pattern to the above data actions, so you won't receive any errors in these modules. However, if one of the modules was previously [cloned](clone-starter-module.md) it will still have the older data action signature and display this error at runtime, "UserAuthorizationException. Customer account number on the request was wrong". The signatures will need to be updated accordingly. One way to resolve this issue is to temporarily clone the module library module again with a new name, then differentiate the new module code with the previously cloned custom module and merge the changes. The temporary module can then be deleted.

### After upgrading to module library version 9.23 (10.0.13 release), cloned modules or view extensions that import "CartlineComponent" or "WishListIconComponent" components may display the errors "export 'CartlineComponent' was not found in '@msdyn365-commerce/components'" or "export 'WishListIconComponent' was not found in '@msdyn365-commerce/components'".

The "CartlineComponent" and "WishListIconComponent" components have been renamed to "CartLineItemComponent" and "WishlistIconComponent" respectively. If the previous component names are used in either a cloned module or a view extension, the build errors mentioned above will be displayed. To fix these issues, update the previous component names to the new component names in the cloned module or view extension code.

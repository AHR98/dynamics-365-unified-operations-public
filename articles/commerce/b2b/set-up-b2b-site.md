# Set up a B2B e-commerce site

[!include [banner](../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic describes how to set up a B2B e-commerce site in Dynamics 365 Commerce.

Business-to-business (B2B) e-commerce sites provide some key capabilities that optimize the workflow for a B2B user. This topic walks through the modules and site settings that need to be configured to enable B2B-specific scenarios.

## Prerequisites

- To setup a B2B e-commerce site, specific features must be enabled and configured in Commerce headquarters as covered in this topic.
- Core experiences such as product discovery, product details page, cart, and checkout are powered by the same modules that are used for business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce sites. Site authors should be familiar with all of the modules supported by Dynamics 365 Commerce. For more information, see [Module library overview](../starter-kit-overview.md).
- This topic assumes that site authors understand the basics of Commerce site builder, templates, fragments, and pages to be able to enable the B2B features for e-commerce sites.

## Site-level settings

Site-level settings can be accessed in site builder under **Site Settings \> Extensions**. The following two site settings apply to B2B scenarios.

- **Enable customer account payments** - This property allows users to pay for orders using customer accounts. Available values for this property are **Enabled for B2B customers**, **Enabled for B2C customers**, **Enabled for all customers**, and **Disabled for all customers**. If your B2B site supports customer accounts, you should select **Enabled for B2C customers**.
- **Enable order quantity limits** â€“ This property allows you to set limits on the number of items that can be ordered for each product or category. Available values for this property are **Enabled for B2B customers**, **Enabled for B2C customers**, **Enabled for all customers**, and **Disabled for all customers**.

> [!NOTE]
> When upgrading to latest version of the module library, you need to follow additional steps to ensure that the site settings described above are available in your environment. For more information, see [Update the app.settings.json file](../e-commerce-extensibility/sdk-updates.md#update-the-appsettingsjson-file).

## Create business partner sign-up pages

To become a business partner, users must first submit a business partner request. The link to the business partner request page will be available on the B2B home page for users to initiate the process. After submitting a business partner request, users will see a confirmation message that the request has been submitted. 

### Create a business partner request page

The request to become a business partner is initiated using the **Partner sign up** module on a business partner request page. This module allows you to collect the user information necessary for the sign-up process. Also, the **Business account address** module to capture the business user's address.

To set up and configure the business partner request page in site builder, follow these steps.

1. Create a template that includes partner sign-up, breadcrumb, header, footer, content block, text block, and product collection modules. Enter "Sign-up" as the name for this template.
1. Create a page named "Business Partner Request" using the **Sign-up** template you created.
1. In the **Header** slot, add the header fragment that is preconfigured with the site header.
1. In the **Footer** slot, add the footer fragment that is preconfigured with the site footer.
1. In the **Main** slot, add a **Container** module. In the module properties pane, set the **Width** value to **Fill Container**.
1. In the **Container** slot, add a **Breadcrumb** module. In the module properties pane under **Links**, configure a link to the home page with link text "Home"..
1. In the **Container** slot, add the **Partner Sign-up** module below the **Breadcrumb** module. In the module properties pane under **Heading**, enter "Become a business partner".
1. In the **Partner sign up** slot, add a **Business account address** module.
1. In the **Container** slot, add a **Text block** module below the **Partner sign up** module. Here you can define some terms and conditions for the sign-up process.
1. Select **Save**, and then select **Preview** to preview the page.
1. Select **Save**, select **Finish editing** to check in the page, and then select **Publish** to publish it.
1. Publish the URL for the page.

### Create a business partner request confirmation page

Once a business partner request is submitted, a confirmation page should be displayed to the user acknowledging their submission. 

To set up and configure the request confirmation page in site builder, follow these steps.

1. Create a page named "Partner Request Confirmation" using the "Sign-up" template.
1. In the **Header** slot, add the header fragment that is preconfigured with the site header.
1. In the **Footer** slot, add the footer fragment that is preconfigured with the site footer.
1. In the **Main** slot, add a **Container** module. In the module properties pane, set the **Width** value to **Fill Container**.
1. In the **Container** slot, add a **Content block** module. In the properties panel under **Heading**, enter "Request submitted." In the **Rich Text** box, add the text "Your request has been submitted". Under **Links**, enter a link to the home page with link text "Back to shopping".
1. Add another container module and then add a **Product Collection** module to it. Configure this module with a recommendation or category list that you want to showcase on this page.
1. Select **Save**, and then select **Preview** to preview the page.
1. Select **Save**, select **Finish editing** to check in the page, and then select **Publish** to publish it.
1. Publish the URL for the page.

To add a link to the request confirmation page in site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to the "Business Partner Request" page you created earlier and select **Edit**. 
1. Select the **Partner Sign up** module slot. In the properties pane under **Link to the Sign-Up Confirmation page**, configure the link to the business partner request page you created earlier. 
1. Select **Save**, select **Finish editing** to check in the page, and then select **Publish** to publish it.

### Add business partner request link to home page

Once the business partner request sign-up and confirmation pages are created, you need to make the sign-up page accessible with a link on the home page. You can do this by adding the link to any content block module on the home page.

To add a business partner request link to the home page in site builder, follow these steps.

1. Go to the home page for your site and select **Edit**.
1. Select a content block module slot. In the module properties pane under **Links**, configure a link to the business partner request page you created earlier with the link text "Sign up to be a business partner" or something similar. Add an image as appropriate.
1. Select **Save**, select **Finish editing** to check in the page, and then select **Publish** to publish it.

For details on how to configure a checkout page and the modules that are needed for checkout including all payment details, see [Checkout module](../add-checkout-module.md).

Once you have a checkout page configured, you need to add **Customer Account Payment** to the payment section of this page, and then save and publish the page. A B2B user will then be able sign in to the e-commerce site and apply their available customer balance amount to their order during checkout.

In addition, under **Site Builder \> Extensions** ensure the Customer Account Payment property is **Enabled for B2B customers.**

## Create order templates pages

There are two order templates pages that can be set up on a B2B e-commerce site. 

An order templates list page displays a list of all order templates available, and is set up using the **Order templates list** module. It allows you to create or delete a template and add items in a template to the cart.

An order templates lines page displays the details of each order template that is displayed on the order templates page, and is set up using the **Order templates lines** module. When a user selects the name of the template on the order template list page, the order templates lines page displays the details of that template.

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

The Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen is an out-of-the-box payment connector that supports various payment instruments globally. 

The following Brazil-specific Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for Adyen features are enabled after the Commerce localization for Brazil has been set up and deployed:

- Support for sales with credit and debit cards (that is, double-purpose cards).
- Saving payment-related data, such as cart type and transaction code (NSU), in sales transactions and reporting it in electronic fiscal documents NFC-e/NF-e/CF-e.

## Double-purpose cards

Double-purpose cards wich are both debit and credit at the same time are widespread in Brazilian retail. 
While paying by card at a store, customers should choose if they prefer to pay by debit or credit.
As a result, the card payment is registered in Adyen with selected payment preference (Debit or Credit).

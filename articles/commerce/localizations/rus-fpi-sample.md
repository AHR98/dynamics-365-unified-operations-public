# Fiscal printer integration sample for Russia

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

## Introduction

The Dynamics 365 Commerce functionality for Russia includes a sample integration of the point of sale (POS) with a fiscal printer. The sample extends the [fiscal integration functionality](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md) and supports the application programming interface (API) of fiscal printers from [ATOL](http://integration.atol.ru/). The sample enables communication with a fiscal printer that is connected via a communication (COM) port by using a native software driver. The sample is provided in the form of source code and is part of the Retail software development kit (SDK).

Microsoft doesn't release any hardware, software, or documentation from ATOL. For information about how to get the fiscal printer and operate it, contact [ATOL](https://www.atol.ru/).

You are responsible for your use of ATOL services, and any use is subject to a separate [end user agreement](http://integration.atol.ru/eula/) between you and ATOL.

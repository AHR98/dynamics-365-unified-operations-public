# Set up and deploy Dynamics 365 Commerce localization for Brazil

[!include[banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic covers how to set up and deploy Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce localization for Brazil.

Dynamics 365 Commerce localization for Brazil consists of several extensions of Commerce components. For example, the extensions let you calculate Brazil-specific taxes, generate electronic fiscal documents for retail sales, print DANFE fiscal receipts containing custom fields, manage Brazil-specific customer information, and issue sales in offline contingency mode with postponed registration of electronic fiscal documents. For more information about Dynamics 365 Commerce localization for Brazil, see [Brazilian localization scope](../../finance/localizations/latam-bra-scope.md) and [Commerce localization for Brazil](latam-bra-commerce-localization.md).

The extensions described here were developed based on the fiscal integration framework. For details about the fiscal integration functionality, see [Overview of fiscal integration for Commerce channels](fiscal-integration-for-retail-channel.md). Brazilian electronic fiscal documents formats are implemented using [Electronic reporting (ER)](../../dev-itpro/analytics/general-electronic-reporting.md).

Commerce localization for Brazil includes extensions for the Commerce runtime (CRT), Retail Server, and point of sale (POS).

## Configuring a production environment

This section provides deployment guidance for enabling Commerce components of the localization of Dynamics 365 Commerce for Brazil.

> [!NOTE]
> Some steps in these procedures vary, depending on the product version you're using. For more information, see [What's new or changed in Dynamics 365 for Retail](../get-started/whats-new.md).

### Using certificates for authentication in tax authority service and digital signing of fiscal documents

A digital sertificate for Application Object Server (AOS) must be stored in Azure Key Vault. 

Digital sertificates for Retail Server must be installed locally and / or it can be stored in Azure Key Vault. Both location types for Retail Server can be configured simultaneously and used according to their priorities. 

For more information about how to work with Azure Key Vault storage, see [Get started with Azure Key Vault](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/key-vault/key-vault-get-started) and [Set up the Azure Key Vault client](../../finance/localizations/setting-up-azure-key-vault-client.md).

Also you can use the [User-defined certificate profiles for retail stores](./certificate-profiles-for-retail-stores.md) feature that supports failover to offline when Key Vault or Headquarters are not available. The feature extends the [Manage secrets for retail channels](../dev-itpro/manage-secrets.md) feature.

> [!NOTE]
> In order to sign NFC-es in offline contingency mode a sertificate must be installed in offline certificate storage of POS (point of sale).

#### Configure certificates to be used in Retail Server

Brazilian **tax service extension** of **Retail server** uses a certificate for authentication in tax authority service, and for digital signing of fiscal documents. 

**Retail server** certificates settings are controlled by **Certificate profiles** in the following way:
- Go to **System administration \> Setup \> Certificate profiles** menu. 
- Create a certificate profile for the appropriate Legal entities. 
- Click on the 'Settings' button per each legal entity.

These certificates can be either installed in the local certificate storage of the machine where Retail Server is deployed, or stored in Azure Key Vault, or both location types for Retail Server can be configured simultaneously and used according to their priorities. The settings opened in the previous step must be specified as follows:
- for the local certificate create a record having **Location type = Local certificate**, and fill in the **Thumbprint** value;
- for Key Vault certificate create a record having **Location type = Key Vault**, and choose **Key Vault certificate**.

#### Configure a certificate in AOS

**Application Object Server** uses a certificate that is stored in Azure Key Vault for authentication in tax authority service for submittion through Commerce Headquarters NFC-es that were issued on POS in offline contingency mode. Also it is needed for digital signing of Discard and Cancellation by substitution requests. Parameters of the certificate must be specified in the following **Fiscal establishment settings**:

1. Go to **Organization administration > Organizations > Fiscal establishments > Fiscal establishments**.
1. Choose the appropriate digital **certificate** for authentication in tax authority service and digital signing of fiscal documents.

> [!NOTE]
> Appropriate distribution jobs must be run once the setup is completed.

# Sort Commerce Data Exchange packages by primary index

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This feature, titled **Sort CDX packages by primary index**, optimizes the data preprocessing performance of data transformation. It is important to note that this feature does not alter any data application logic for a Commerce Scale Unit (CSU) or a Modern POS offline database nor improve performance for either of these.

## Prerequisites

The **Sort CDX packages by primary index** feature must be turned on in the **Feature management** workspace. For more information, see [Feature management overview](../../fin-ops-core/fin-ops/get-started/feature-management/feature-management-overview.md).

## Feature value

This feature provides additional performance when using DataVerse with Digital Commerce, Headless Commerce, or Dynamics 365 Commerce (When DataVerse is used).

## Using this feature

This feature, once turned on in **Feature management**, will function without visibility to the end user.

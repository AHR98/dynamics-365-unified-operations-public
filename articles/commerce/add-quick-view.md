This topic covers Product quick view module and describes how to add them to site pages in Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce.

## Overview

When browsing products in a list or a list page, the product quick view module allows a user to quickly view the product information and add it to bag without navigating to a product details page. It provides a quick snippet of the product information that is necessary to make an add to cart decision. For more details and options to buy, it also provides a link to the product details page.

Its supported on the **Search results** module and **Product collection** module.


> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Quick View** module is available in the Dynamics 365 Commerce 10.0.17 release.

## Module properties
The module properties are similar to a buy box module as it supports some of the same functions supported within a buy box.

- **Heading tag** â€“ This property defines the heading tag for the product title. If the buy box is at the top of the page, this property should be set to **h1** to meet accessibility standards. 

- **Enable "shop similar looks" recommendations** - This property allows the buy box to show links to products that look similar to the currently viewed item. This feature is available in Commerce release 10.0.13 and later.

## Site settings

The module also respects the Site Settings->Extensions for **Add to cart** similar to Buy box. It will navigate to cart page or show a notification as per the site author's selection.

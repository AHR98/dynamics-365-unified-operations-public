This topic covers how to manage Dynamics 365 Commerce user roles in Microsoft Teams.

As you create a team per store or channel in Microsoft Teams, a group membership corresponding to the team is created, for example `HOUSTON_D365@<YourTenantAADDomain>.com`. All the store workers under a team group membership are assigned one of two user roles: "owner" or "member." A store employee with the owner user role, typically a store manager, can perform operations such as adding a private channel and adding or deleting members. 

The following image shows an example list of team members and their user roles in Microsoft Teams.

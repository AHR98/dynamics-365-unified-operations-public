# Adding fields to Excel sheet for editing retail transactions

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

When the Excel file is generated to edit the transactions, the Excel file is populated with some default fields. If a field that needs to be updated is not visible on the generated Excel file by default, the same can be added to the Excel file by following the below steps:
1.	Download & open the Excel file from the **Statements** page, **Retail transactions** page or the **Transaction validation failures** tile on the **Store financials** workspace 
2.	Click on the **Design** button
3.	Click on the pencil button on the desired table and find the field that you want to add in the list of available fields, click on **Add** and then on **Update**
You can also shuffle fields around and order them as you prefer.   
4.	Once the update is finished, click on **Refresh** to fetch the data for the new column

The new field & data for the field should now be available in Excel for editing

# Run experiments on an e-commerce page
## Overview
Web-based experimentation is the process of using controlled experiments such as A/B testing to experiment with variations of webpages and determining which changes result in more conversions, thereby better customer adoption and engagement.

Dynamics 365 Commerce supports the creation, editing, and management of page and content treatments in site builder. Integrations with third-party solution providers enable the creation of experiments and treatment assignments. Event streams from the web storefront support the analytics and reports defining experiment results in the third-party solution.

## Prerequisites

## Create an experiment

## Create webpage variations for the experiment

1.	Go to the “Experiments” tab in site builder’s left nav bar.
1.	Click “Connect” to link to an experiment in the test connector or the third-party connector.

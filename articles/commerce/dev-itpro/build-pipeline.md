# Setup build pipeline for Commerce SDK

[!include [banner](../../../includes/banner.md)]

This topic applies to the Retail SDK version 10.0.19 and later, the steps documented here will not work if you are using the legacy Retail SDK from the LCS Dev VM, this applicable if you are using the new independent extension model (consuming the packages from the public feed) and using the indepednet packaging and extension model.

E.g. The list page on the Adventure works theme is acheived as a view extesion, it has a  horizontal refiner compared to the left pane refiner in Fabrikam theme.

Similarly, there are many modules that showcase module defintion extensions - E.g. [Cart icon module](add-cart-icon.md) allows two new slots for Empty Cart and Promotional Content. These slots are acheived via module definition extension. Another example would be the Header module, where a new property is added **Mobile Logo** for supporting a logo on Mobile view port. This Mobile Logo is implemented as a Header module definition extension.

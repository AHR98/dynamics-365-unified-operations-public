# Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for PayPal

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This topic provides an overview of the Microsoft Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for PayPal(PayPal connector). It includes a list of supported features and functionality, a guide to setting up and configuring the connector, troubleshooting information, and descriptions of some common issues.

## Key terms

| Term | Description |
|---|---|
| PayPal Wallet | Also known as the PayPal "button", PayPal Wallet describes customer experience and integration supported by the PayPal Connector. |
| Wallet | A payment type which does not include traditional payment characteristics, such as the BIN range and expiration date, that are used to differentiate among credit and debit card types. |

## Overview

Microsoft Dynamics 365 Commerce now offers an out of box integration for PayPal Wallet. When the PayPal Connector is configured, the PayPal button is a selectable payment method as part of online order checkout. When users select "PayPal" they are directed to complete their payment directly with PayPal and then returned to the web storefront for order completion.  

The PayPal connector is implemented using the same payments SDK that is leveraged for credit card payments. To better support PayPal payments, support for non-credit card payments has also been enhanced with the addition of support for "Wallet" payment types. Specifically, PayPal payments do not return a BIN range. To support PayPal and other wallet payments, a new mapping has been introduced for payments that do not include BIN range. This new mapping can also be used to augment existing BIN range mapping for credit card payment methods. For more details, visit [**Wallet documentation**](articles/commerce/wallets.md). 

## Availability

The Microsoft Dynamics 365 Payment Connector for PayPal is not available in China. For other locales where Dynamics 365 Commerce is available, there are currently no restrictions. 

## Functional overview

### PayPal Wallet in Storefront 

The connector supports the use of the PayPal Wallet, or PayPal button, for e-commerce payments. When the connector is configured for the web Storefront, at the time of 
customers will be presented with the option to pay using the PayPal button. When the customer selects the PayPal button, they will be redirected to a PayPal Wallet mini browser window where they will be authenticated by PayPal and be able to select their method of payment. Upon succesful authentication and selection of a payment method, the customer will be redirected back to the storefront with the PayPal payment loaded into the checkout form. Once the order is placed, the PayPal payment will be included as a payment line on the order and it will by synchronized to the Commerce back office.

For more information on PayPal Wallet, please visit the [PayPal Checkout page](https://www.paypal.com/merchantapps/appcenter/acceptpayments/checkout) hosted by PayPal. 

### Fulfillment

Orders with PayPal payment lines are fulfilled in the same was as orders that are paid using credit card. When an order is created, the PayPal payment is added in an "Authorized" state. Upon fulfillment, whether the order is shipped to the customer from a distribution center, or picked up in a store, the payment authorization associated with the order is then "Captured" using the same payments SDK requests used to capture credit card payments. 

Fulfillment for PayPal orders supports incremental capture. This means that if an order is partially fulfilled and invoiced, a portion of the original authorization will be captured and, rather than getting a new authorization for the remainder, the same original authorization will be referenced when the remainder of the order is fulfilled. 

### Authorization expiration

Orders made using the PayPal connector should be fulfilled within 30 days. If an order cannot be fulfilled or invoiced within 30 days, the original authorization will expire. The PayPal Connector does not currently support billing agreements. Recurring billing agreements, similar to recurring card references/tokens are required to automatically generate new authorizations after original authorization exipry. This means that if an authorization expires, the order will fall into a 'Do not process' state and customer will need to be contacted to arrange for an alternate form of payment. 

Billing agreement support, which allows for creation of new authorizations upon expiration of the original authorization, will be added in a future release.

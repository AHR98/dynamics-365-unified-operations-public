# Configure sales tax for online orders

[!include [banner](includes/banner.md)]

Your e-commerce channel may want to support options like delivery or pickup for online orders. The sales tax applicability is based on the option selected by your online customers. 
This topic provides an overview of sales tax group selection for different online order types using destination-based taxes vs customer account-based taxes settings. 

## Destination-based taxes for online orders
In general, taxes for online orders that ship to customer addresses are defined by the destination. Every sales tax group has a retail destination-based tax configuration in which your business can define destination details such as county/region, state, county, and city in a hierarchical form.
### Orders delivered to customer address
When an online order is placed, the Commerce tax engine uses the delivery address of every line item in the order and finds sales tax groups with matching destination-based tax criteria. For example, for an online order with a line-item delivery address to San Francisco, California, the tax engine will find the sales tax group and sales tax code for California and then calculate tax for each line item accordingly.
### Order pickup in store
For order lines with pickup in store or curbside pickup specified, the tax group from the selected pickup store will be applied. For details about how to set up sales taxes for a given store, see [Set other tax options for stores](https://docs.microsoft.com/dynamicsax-2012/appuser-itpro/set-other-tax-options-for-stores)

## Customerâ€™s account-based taxes for online orders
There may be a business scenario where you want to configure a Sales Tax Group on a specific customer account in headquarters.  In Commerce headquarters, there are two places where you can configure sales tax on a customer account as follows:

1.	On **Customer** details page under **Invoice and delivery** tab **Sales Tax group** field. 
2.	On **Customer** details page, for a specific **Customer Address** > **Advanced** settings, under **General** tab Sales tax group field.


[!Tip]
For online customer orders, if you want to apply only the destination-based taxes and avoid customer account based taxes, ensure that Customer account > Invoice and delivery tab > Sales tax group field is empty.  You should also check **default customer** settings for online channel and **Customer group** settings as well and make sure to leave Sales tax group field as blank. This way **new customers** those sign-up via online channel do not inherit the Sales tax group settings from **default customer** settings or from **Customer group** settings. 

## Destination-based vs customer account-based taxes applicability 

Below matrix illustrates how a destination-based taxes vs customer account bases taxes are applied for online orders.

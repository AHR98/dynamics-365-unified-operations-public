# Configure absence manager role

[!include [Applies to Human Resources](../includes/applies-to-hr.md)]

[!include [preview feature](./includes/preview-feature.md)]

In some organizations, a people manager might not be managing the leave for their team. Instead, an absence manager might handle this process for team members across multiple departments and teams. Absence managers will be able to manage leave with the following capabilities:

- Review and approve time off based on an alternate hierarchy.
- View team member balances.
- View the absence calendar.

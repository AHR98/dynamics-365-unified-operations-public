## Skill mapping and Skill mapping profiles

You can create a skill-mapping search to find a worker, applicant, or contact person who is qualified to perform a specific type of task in Dynamics 365 Human Resources. Skill-mapping searches look across skills, education, certificates, positions of trust and project experience and return results that match the criteria entered. For example, it might be useful to know which workers in your organization earned their CPA.

Skill-mapping profiles allow you to find current employees or candidates with qualifications that directly correspond to business needs. For example, you could create a skill-mapping profile for an open position in your organization. By creating a profile for a particular job and copying the skills, education and certificates from that job to the profile, you can quickly search workers, applicants and contact persons who match one or more of the criteria entered on the profile and view a list of the candidates whose skills most closely match the skills required for the job.

> [!NOTE]
> Only workers, applicants, and contact persons who are selected to be included in skill mapping searches can be displayed in a skill-mapping results list, or included in a skill profile. To include a worker, applicant, or contact person in skill mapping searches, set the **Include in skill mapping** selection to **Yes** in the following pages:<br><br>
> - Worker<br>
> - Employee<br>
> - Applicant<br>
> - Contacts<br>



## Skill gap analysis and skill profile analysis

You can create a skill profile analysis to view a list of the competencies of a worker, applicant, or contact person as of a specific date. You can create a skill gap analysis to compare a personâ€™s skills and the skills that are required for a specific job.

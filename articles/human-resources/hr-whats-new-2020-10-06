## Coming soon
### Checklist entities included in Common Data Service

Checklist entities for Onboarding, Offboarding, Transfers, and Business processes will be available soon in Common Data Service.

### Benefits management reason codes

Benefits management reason codes will soon be combined with existing reason codes in Human Resources.

After you update the name, the reason code will appear under the existing reason code form in Personnel management.

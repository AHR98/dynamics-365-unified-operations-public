# Create transfer orders from the warehouse app

[!include [banner](../includes/banner.md)]

This feature lets warehouse workers create and process transfer orders directly from the warehouse app. Workers start by scanning one or more license plates using the app, which then creates the required transfer order and order lines based on the on-hand inventory registered for those license plates. On receiving the "complete order" signal from the warehouse app, Supply Chain Management can automatically process the outbound transfer order shipment using the "License plate guided" strategy process running in batch.
